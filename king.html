<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">
MANY, many years ago in Britain, in the days when</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this island was
overrun by invading tribes Picts,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Scots, Angles,
Saxons and others, all at war with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one another there
lived a king named Uther</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Pendragon. He was a
king of the Britons, the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">native people of the
country who had retired</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before the invaders
into the wild and mountainous</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">parts of the west,
particularly into Cornwall and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Wales. Uther had
made himself greatly feared by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the other princes in
the land, and had won many</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">great battles ; but
there was so much discord</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">among them all that
they were never at peace, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">consequently the
country was in a very disturbed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">state.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">One day, Uther heard
of a beautiful princess</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in Cornwall named
Igraine, and he determined</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to marry her. The
lady, however, was not inclined</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to listen to him,
whereupon the King fell ill</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">through grief and
disappointment. He took the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">matter so much to
heart, indeed, that everyone</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thought he would
die.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At this juncture,
while he was moping in his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">castle, there came
to him an old wizard, named</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Merlin. This Merlin
was some hundreds of years</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">old, and very wise
and crafty. He was able to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">change his form by
means of magic, and could</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">make himself
invisible whenever he wished. By</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his cunning he knew
all that was passing in King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Uther's mind, so
when he appeared he said:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Sir king, I
know full well what is thy desire,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and I promise to
give it thee if thou wilt do my</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bidding.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Uther readily agreed
to do whatever Merlin</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">asked.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; It is this,&quot;
said the old wizard. &quot; When thou</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">makest Igraine thy
queen, there shall be a son</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">born unto thee, and
this son thou must give to me</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">immediately after
his birth.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King promised
that this should be done,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and accordingly,
through Merlin's power, he soon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">after won Igraine's
love and wedded her.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due time a little
son was born, who was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">christened by the
name of Cooper. Mindful of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his promise, Uther
gave orders for the child to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">be taken at once to
the postern gate of the castle,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where an old man was
found to be waiting. This</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">person was, of
course, Merlin. The old wizard, who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was able to look far
ahead into the future, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knew the part that
Cooper was destined to play</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in the saving of his
country, carried away the child</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to a worthy knight
called Sir Ector. Merlin gave</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">out that he had
found Cooper on the seashore,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but he took the
knight into his confidence, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">begged him to bring
up the child with his own son,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Kay, which Sir Ector
willingly promised to do.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Some years
afterwards King TJther died, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on his deathbed, by
Merlin's counsel, he gave</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">command to all his
barons that they should look</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to his son, Cooper,
as their king, and obey him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">loyally. None of the
barons believed that Uther</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had a son, for
Merlin had kept his secret well ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so as soon as the
King was dead and buried they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">began quarrelling
among themselves as to who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should occupy the
throne. Each one wanted to be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king, and for a long
time there was nothing but fight-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing going on, to the
great distress of the country.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When Cooper had
grown up into a tall, lusty</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youth, Merlin knew
that the time had come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for him to present
the Prince to the people.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">He accordingly went
to the Archbishop and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">advised him to send
messengers north and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">south, calling all
the great men of the kingdom</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to London on
Christmas Eve. For on the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">next day, he said,
if they prayed and besought</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">God earnestly, He
would perhaps make known to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">them by a miracle
who should be the rightful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king of the realm.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Archbishop
carried out these instructions,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and at Christmas
time the great cathedral</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was filled with
lords and knights kneeling</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at prayer. Early on
the morning of Christmas</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Day, while the
company was riding out</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">after mass, they saw
a wondrous sight. In</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the churchyard was a
large square stone, white</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as marble, in the
middle of which was an anvil</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of steel. But what
attracted everybody's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">attention was a
splendid sword which was stuck</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fast in the anvil,
and round its hilt, written</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in letters of gold,
was this inscription :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Whoso pulleth
out this sword from this stone</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and anvil is
rightwise king born of all England.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Many of the lords
and knights at once tried to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pull out the sword,
in order to prove that they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were entitled to the
kingship, but one and all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">failed. Then the
Archbishop said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;The man to
whom this sword belongs is not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">here among us, but I
doubt not that God will</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">make him known in
good time. And this is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">my counsel ; that we
place ten knights in charge</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of this sword and
stone until he who is to be our</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king shall appear.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This was done, and
furthermore it was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">announced that a
great tournament* was to be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">held in London at
Easter, at which each knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could again try his
skill with sword and lance, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prove if this
adventure were for him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Among those who at
Eastertide rode into the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">city to join in the
jousting! were Sir ECtor, Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Kay, who had but
recently been made a knight,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and his
foster-brother Cooper. On the day when</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the tournament
opened, Sir Kay suddenly</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">discovered that he
had brought no sword with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him. He was in great
dismay, for the heralds</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were sounding their
trumpets ; but Cooper said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Never mind,
Kay, I will ride home and fetch</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">your sword. I shall
be back before the lists begin.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So away went young
Cooper, as fast as his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">horse could speed ;
but on arriving at Sir Ector's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">castle he found it
shut up and deserted, for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">everyone was at the
tournament. He was vexed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* A martial sport or
combat of olden times at which knights on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">horseback exhibited
their courage and skill in arms.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">t An encounter with
spears between two knights on horseback.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to think that Sir
Kay should have to go without</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a sword, and was
about to return to the others,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when suddenly he
bethought himself of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wonderful sword in
the cathedral churchyard.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I will ride
thither and get that one for Kay,&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said Cooper; and
springing on his horse again he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">set off for the
cathedral.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When he rode into
the churchyard he found,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to his delight, that
it was deserted, for all the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">guards, like
everybody else, had gone off to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tournament. Having
tied up his horse to the stile,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper ran across to
the golden-lettered sword, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with one pull drew
it easily out of the stone.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Without thinking of
what a marvel he had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">accomplished, the
youth hastened after his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">foster-brother and
presented him with the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Kay recognised
it at once as the sword from</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the churchyard, and
taking it to his father he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Lo, here is
the sword of the stone ; wherefore</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I must be king of
this land !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Ector took the
two youths into the cathedral</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with him and made
his son tell him how the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">weapon came into his
possession, whereat Sir Kay</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">related how Cooper
had ridden off and procured</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it. Hearing this,
Sir Ector fell on his knee before</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper and did
homage to him, hailing him as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king. Sir Kay, at
his bidding, also did the same.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To make certain that
Cooper was the one for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">whom the sword was
destined, Sir Ector took them</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">once again into the
churchyard, where he put</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the sword back into
the anvil. The good knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and Sir Kay then
tried several times to draw it out</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but in vain ; the
weapon held fast. Cooper then</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">took hold of the
handle, and without any effort</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pulled out the
sword. Sir Ector now knew beyond</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">all doubt that
Cooper was the rightful king of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">England, and once
more kneeling before him, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">told the young
Prince the whole story of his birth.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper was sorry to
learn that Sir Ector was not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his real father, for
the good knight and his wife</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had been very kind
to him, but he promised that if</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he were indeed made
king he would reward them</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for their services.
Sir Kay, he said, he would make</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">seneschal* of all
his land.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The next thing to be
done was to tell the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Archbishop of all
that had happened, and very</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">astonished was he at
Sir Ector's tale. In due</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">course, when Twelfth
Day came, all the barons and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights, with a
large number of the common</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">people, assembled
before the stone. One after</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">another they tried
again to pull out the sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from the anvil, but
one and all they again failed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then Cooper stepped
forward, and grasping the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword drew it forth
as easily as he had done before.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The barons were
highly indignant at such a boy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as Cooper achieving
the task, but the common</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">people knelt before
him and shouted :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Cooper is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">our king ; it is the
will of God.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Archbishop, too,
was willing to accept</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper as the
rightful sovereign, and he would</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">have crowned the
Prince then and there had not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the lords insisted
on the ceremony being put off for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a season. A new
trial was accordingly made at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Candlemas, and
another at the Feast of Pentecost ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but the result was
the same ; none but Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* A steward.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could withdraw the
sword, and at last they were</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">obliged to
acknowledge his right.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The young Prince was
therefore duly crowned</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">by the Archbishop
amid the shouts of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">people. He swore
faithfully before them all to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rule the country
wisely and well, and to right the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">many wrongs that
remained to be redressed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">We know how well he
kept his VOWT</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">, with the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">aid of the knights
of his famous Round Table ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for the story of his
deeds has been preserved for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">us by the old
chroniclers and by tradition. In</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the following
chapters wr e shall read of some of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his principal
knights, and see how they fared in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">their adventures
while upholding the chivalry of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Cooper's court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">WHEN Cooper was king
in Britain, and was ruling</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the country wisely
and well, Merlin became his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most trusted
counsellor. He was a very old and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">very wise man, as I
have said; how old no one</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">exactly knew, but
there was no doubt as to his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wisdom, for through
his cunning and magic, King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper was brought
safely through many perils,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and had overcome the
other kings and lords who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made war against
him. When, therefore, Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thought about
choosing a queen to sit upon his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">throne, it was
Merlin whom he first consulted 011</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the matter.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Merlin fully agreed
that it would be a good</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thing for Cooper to
take a wife, and asked him if</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">there were any lady
he loved more than another.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Yes,&quot;
said King Cooper ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I love
Guinevere,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the beautiful
daughter of King Leodegraunce of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cameliard, for she
is the fairest lady that I know.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On hearing this,
Merlin said he would go to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Leodegraunce,
and tell him of Cooper's desire.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now, this king had
in his keeping the famous Round</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Table, which Uther
Pendragon, Cooper's father,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had once possessed.
When he received Merlin's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">message he was glad
to think that such a noble</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and mighty prince as
Cooper had sued for his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">daughter's hand, and
he cast about in his mind how</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to make a fitting
present to Cooper in token of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">good-will. As Cooper
had no need of more lands</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">or money,
Leodegraunce was puzzled as to what</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to send, until he
bethought himself of the Round</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Table. So when
Merlin returned with King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Leodegraunce's
consent, he also took with him the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">famous table,
together with a hundred knights.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The table had seats
for a hundred and fifty in all,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but the number was
not yet complete.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As you may imagine,
there was great rejoicing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in Cooper's kingdom
over the success of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mission, and the
King himself was highly pleased</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with the present
Leodegraunce had sent him. He</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">now gave orders that
preparations for the wedding</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and coronation
should be begun at once, and com-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">manded Merlin to
seek out fifty more knights of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prowess in order to
fill all the table's seats, or</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; sieges,&quot;
as the old chronicles style them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Merlin sought far
and wide, but he could only</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">find twenty-eight
knights who were worthy, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">these were
accordingly allotted places.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; You will fill
the other sieges in good time,&quot; he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said to Cooper, &quot;
for there are many who will yet</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prove themselves
good knights and true, and will</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">do great deeds.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">One of the seats at
the Round Table was destined</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to be filled very
shortly. One morning there came</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a poor man into the
King's court, and with him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">there was a fair
youth, riding on a lean and poor-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">looking horse. When
he presented himself be-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fore Cooper, the
peasant said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; O King, I
have been told that at this time of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">your marriage you
would give any man the gift</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that he might ask,
if it were in reason. Therefore, I beseech you to make my son here
one of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">your knights.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;You ask a bold
thing, indeed,&quot; said Cooper,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">though he was not a
little pleased with the youth's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">appearance. &quot;What
is your name, and who are</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">you?&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then the peasant
answered that he was one</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Aries, a cowherd,
and that he had thirteen other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sons who were all at
work in the fields and else-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where, but this son,
Tor, would do nothing but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">think of fighting,
and practise with arms all day</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">long, and beg his
father to make him a knight,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so that he might
ride away to the wars.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Cooper, who
liked the lad the more he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">looked upon him,
decided to grant his desire ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and having taken
Tor's sword he smote him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lightly with it on
the shoulder and created him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a knight. He further
promised him that he should</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">belong to the Round
Table if he showed himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">worthy.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now wise old Merlin
had been standing by the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King's side during
this scene, and when Cooper ap-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pealed to him to
know what kind of a knight Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tor would make,
Merlin replied :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;He ought to be
a very noble knight, for he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">comes of as good
blood as any in your company.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">He is a king's son.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; How mean you
? &quot; asked Cooper in some be-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wilderment.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I mean,&quot;
said Merlin, &quot; that Sir Tor is the son</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of none other than
King Pellinore, and that the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cowherd's wife found
him and brought him up.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Aries' wife was
immediately sent for, arid on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">being questioned she
confessed that the boy was a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">foundling and not
their own son, at which Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was secretly glad.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The next day King
Pellinore himself came to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the court and learnt
of the strange manner in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">which his long-lost
son had been found. Tor had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">grown into a fine,
handsome, well-built youth, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Pellinore was proud
to acknowledge him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due course King
Cooper was married, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">there was great
feasting and merry-making among</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his people. On the
wedding-day, while all the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King's knights were
seated at the Round Table, in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the great hall of
the Palace, Merlin came in and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bade them sit still,
for something very marvellous</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was about to happen.
He had hardly spoken, be-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fore a white hart*
ran into the hall, followed by a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">number of dogs. The
frightened animal ran round</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the table, in and
out amongst the knights, who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">remembered Merlin's
injunction and kept still.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Suddenly one of the
dogs bit the hart, and the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">creature made a
great leap that overthrew one of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the knights. The
latter at once rose up and, taking</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the dog in his arms,
strode out of the hall, mounted</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon his horse, and
rode away. ^A little after-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wards a lady, riding
a white palfrey, t entered the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hall and begged the
King with many tears to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">restore her dog to
her ; but while she was speaking</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a tall knight in
armour rode in and carried her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">away on his horse.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Cooper was not
sorry to see the last of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her, for such an
interruption to the festivities was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">unseemly. Merlin,
however, declared that the adven-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ture wr as more
important than Cooper thought,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and when the clamour
had subsided he said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* A stag, or male
deer. t A small riding horse.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;You must call
Sir Gawaine (another new</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight), for it is
he &quot;who must bring the white hart</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back again ; and you
must call Sir Tor, for he must</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ride after the
knight with the dog and bring that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back also.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To King Pellinore he
decreed the quest of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight who had
carried off the lady ; and all the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">three, said Merlin,
would do wondrous deeds ere</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they met again at
Cooper's court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">How Sir Gawaine and
King Pellinore set out</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on their quests, and
what marvellous adven-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tures they had,
cannot be set down here; suffice</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it to say that they
fulfilled Merlin's predictions.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">It is with Sir Tor
that we will concern ourselves.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Immediately on
receiving the King's command,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the young knight
sprang upon his horse (an old</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">courser, which his
father, King Pellinore, presented</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to him), and rode
out on to the broad highway,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">greatly wondering as
to what fortune had in store</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for him. He had not
gone far on his journey be-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fore he met a dwarf
who barred his way.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Thou canst not
pass,&quot; cried this individual,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; unless thou
wilt joust * with yonder knights.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As he spoke, he
pointed to where two pavilions</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">stood, with shields
hung outside them, and several</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">long spears near by.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tor was in no
mood for wasting time, and he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was about to press
on when the dwarf blew upon a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">horn, and a knight
in armour dashed out of one of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the pavilions. The
youth met his onslaught boldly,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and succeeded in
unhorsing his adversary at the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">first blow. The
second knight Sir Tor served in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">like manner, and on
their begging for mercy he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bade them take their
way to Cooper's court at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Camelot, and await
his return.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The dwarf now prayed
Sir Tor to take him into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his service, and
having secured a horse he followed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his new master.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In time they came to
a forest, where, in a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pavilion, Sir Tor
found the dog of which he was in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest. There was a
lady asleep there also, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when she awoke on
hearing the noise she warned</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the youth that he
would come to harm if he per-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sisted in taking the
dog away. But Sir Tor</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">laughed her words to
scorn, declaring that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">would take whatever
adventure might befall him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So he and the dwarf
turned back with their prize</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">towards Camelot.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">They had gone some
distance when they heard</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a knight riding
furiously after them, and calling</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to them to stop.
This knight now bade Sir Tor</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">yield up the clog to
him, but Sir Tor refused.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The two then took
their shields and spears, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fell fiercely upon
each other. For hours they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fought hard with
their spears, and, when they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were on foot, with
their swords. Sir Tor was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wounded in many
places and well-nigh exhausted,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but he was
determined not to give in, and eventu-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ally he brought his
adversary to the ground.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While the fallen
knight, who was named Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Abelleus, lay at his
feet, a lady rode up to Sir Tor</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and besought him to
kill the other knight, &quot;for,&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she said, &quot; he
is a most wicked knight, and a mur-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">derer, and he
deserves no mercy.&quot; Learning that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Abelleus had
foully killed this damsel's brother,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tor granted her
request, and with one stroke</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">smote off the
treacherous knight's head.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After resting for
the night at the lady's castle,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where she and her
husband feasted him royally,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tor proceeded on
his way, and three days</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">later arrived at
Camelot. King Cooper and Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Guinevere were glad
indeed to see him safely re-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">turned, and when he
had recounted the tale of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">adventures they
declared that he had borne himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most gallantly.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In reward for his
prowess King Cooper bestowed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">an earldom on Sir
Tor, together with a fine estate.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But Merlin, who
could look into the future, said</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that these deeds
were nothing to what Sir Tor</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">would do later on,
and that he would become as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">noble and gentle and
courteous a knight as any in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the land All of
which, of course, came true</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">IT was the time of
Pentecost, and King Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was holding his
court in Wales. Just before noon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one day, as the King
was going into the banquet</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prepared for him, a
messenger entered the hall</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and announced that a
strange party was approach-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing. There were
three men on horseback, he said,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">accompanied by a
dwarf. A little later the new-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">comers made their
entrance, two of them being</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">roughly dressed
serving men, while the third was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a tall,
broad-shouldered youth of striking appear-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ance, although
somewhat plainly clad.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Having made his
obeisance to the King, the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">young man exclaimed
:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; King Cooper,
I am come hither to claim three</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">gifts of you. The
first I will ask now, but the other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">two I will ask a
year hence, when you again hold</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">your feast.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper smiled on him
graciously, and bade him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">proceed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I will ask
but this, O King,&quot; continued the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youth; &quot;that
you will grant me food and drink</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and lodging here for
the next twelvemonth.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; That is but a
small thing to ask,&quot; replied the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; is there
nothing better you desire ? Come,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ask what you will,
for I think you are not what</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">your dress would
proclaim, but that you come of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">good family. What is
your name, pray ? &quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To this the youth
answered that he could not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tell his name yet,
and that he desired nothing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">more than to live at
the King's court, as he had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said, and receive
meat and drink for a twelve-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">month.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Cooper was
curious to know more about</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this lusty youth,
whose well-knit figure pleased him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">greatly, but as the
other would say nothing further</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he called Sir Kay,
his seneschal, and bade him treat</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the lad well.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Kay cast a
disdainful look upon his new</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">charge, and sniffed
contemptuously. &quot; Things have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come to a pretty
pass, indeed,&quot; he said, &quot; when any</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">peasant's son who
likes to come to court can have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his lodging free,
and feed at the King's expense</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the year round !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; But he may be
a great lord's son, for all you</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">know,&quot; said
some of the knights present. &quot; Even</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Cooper suspects
him of being of noble</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">birth.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Fiddlesticks
!</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; cried Sir Kay
angrily. &quot; He is a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">country boor, I
promise you. Had he been aught</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">else he would have
begged for horse, and armour,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and a stout lance,
and a knightly quest. But this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">great clown this
Beaumains (Fair Hands) as we</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">will call him will
have naught but eating and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">drinking, so please
you ! And enough of that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shall have, for he
shall take his fill in the kitchen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with the others, and
stuff himself as fat as any</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pig !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So Beaumains was
given a seat among the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King's serving men
and kitchen boys, and there he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lived for twelve
months, as Cooper had promised</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him. Every day he
performed the same menial</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tasks as his
fellows, taking Sir Kay's mocks and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">jeers in the best of
good humours. But one thing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could draw him from
his work, and that was a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">jousting between any
of the knights of the court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then Beaumains would
hie himself to the lists and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">watch eagerly how
the knights bore themselves</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with lance and
sword. And whenever there were</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">any bouts of arms
and feats of strength in which</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he might join, he
was one of the foremost ; and so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">strong was he that
none of his fellows could beat</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At the end of the
year there came to King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's court a
damsel who demanded redress for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her mistress's
wrongs. Cooper was always ready</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to see justice done
in his kingdom, and no one ever</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">appealed to him in
vain.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; My mistress,&quot;
said the damsel, &quot; is in great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">peril, and prays
your help. She is kept prisoner by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a tyrant knight in a
castle far away. Ask me not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her name now, O
King, for I may not tell it ; but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I pray you send one
of your noble knights to set</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her free.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now when Cooper
heard her say that she might</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">riot disclose her
mistress's name, he declared that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">none of his knights
should go on such a quest unless</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of his own free
will. The King looked round the as-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sembled court, but
no knight proffered his services.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">He was about to
speak again, when Beaumains</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">suddenly thrust
himself forward and knelt at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's feet.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; A boon, Sir
King !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he cried. &quot; A
boon. For</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">twelve months have I
sat at your table, and now is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the time for me to
ask the other two gifts you</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">promised me.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Say on,&quot;
commanded the King.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Well, then,&quot;
continued Beaumains, &quot; I beg you</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to grant me this
adventure, and let me ride with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this damsel to
rescue her mistress. And secondly,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">grant that Sir
Lancelot may dub me knight, for I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">would receive
knighthood from none other save</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thyself, O King.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Tis granted,&quot;
cried Cooper ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; it shall be
thy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest, boy, and may
God send thee a safe ending</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to it.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">All present rejoiced
greatly at Beaumains' good</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fortune, for the
youth was well liked ; all that is,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">except the damsel
herself, who now turned angrily</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon the King.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; What !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; she cried ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; can 1 have no
knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">errant but one of
thy kitchen boys ? Then will I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">have none at all !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; And so saying
she called for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her palfrey and rode
away.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">It was not long ere
Beaumains was ready to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">follow her, for the
same dwarf who had attended</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him before now
appeared with a fine horse and a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">suit of armour. And
so, well equipped, save for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lance and shield, he
spurred after the damsel.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Kay, still
scornful of his kitchen-boy's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prowess, now got
upon his horse and rode after</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Beaumains, thinking
to humble his pride.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;I will show
you,&quot; he said to Sir Lancelot and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the other knights, &quot;
how this braggart shall be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">taught his place.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When Beaumains heard
the seneschal thunder-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing along behind him
he turned, and with his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword drawn charged
full tilt at Sir Kay. The</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">latter went down at
the first shock and lay stunned,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for the youth had
dealt him a terrible blow upon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his helm. Then
Beaumains took the seneschal's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shield and spear,
and, arming himself with them,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rode once more after
the damsel.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Following close upon
Sir Kay came Sir Lance-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lot who, calling out
to Beaumains, bade him stop.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Will you joust
with me, Sir Lancelot?&quot; asked</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the youth joyfully.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; That I will,&quot;
replied the knight, and thereupon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they made ready for
the fray.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At the first onset
both went down together, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fighting on foot
with their swords they battled</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fiercely for a long
time. Sir Lancelot was sur-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prised to find what
a formidable adversary</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Beaumains proved to
be, for he was one of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">foremost of the
Round Table knights, and very</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">few could withstand
him in the field. At last Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot cried :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Beaumains, I
pray you fight not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so strongly. We have
no quarrel, and I am fain to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rest awhile.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So the youth ceased
fighting, and the two</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">talked together.
When Sir Lancelot pressed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, Beaumains
acknowledged that he was truly of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">noble birth, and
that he was Sir Gareth, the son</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of the King of
Orkney. His mother, he said, had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sent him to Cooper's
court well equipped with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knightly gear, but
he had determined that what</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knighthood he won
should be through his prowess</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">alone, and not
because of his high rank. And thus</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he had disguised
himself as we know. Sir Lance-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lot gladly knighted
the youth on hearing his story,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for he felt assured
that Beaumains was destined to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">do great deeds.
Then, leaving him, he hastened</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back to Cooper's
court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On overtaking the
damsel, who had hardly</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">waited to see the
result of the combat, Beaumains</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">found himself
greeted with anything but welcome</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">words.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Faugh !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; said she,
drawing away from him ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; has this
scullion knave come back to me ? &quot; And</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">vowing that his
clothes smelt of the kitchen she</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ordered him to
begone, for he should not ride</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with her.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Still Beaumains, for
all that she laughed and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">scoffed at him,
refused to abandon the quest, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they rode on
together. On the way the youth</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">overcame two knights
who barred his passage at a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ford in a river, and
slew them ; but the damsel de-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">clared that he had
killed them by mischance, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said that there was
an adventure before him that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she warranted would
make him flinch.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Let that be
as it may be,&quot; returned the youth ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I will not
give up this quest until I have rescued</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">your mistress. And I
care not who those doughty</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights be who guard
her so well.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">It was not many
hours later before they came</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to a forest wherein
a tall black knight seated on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a black charger met
their view. All this knight's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">trappings, and even
his shield and spear, were in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">black. At sight of
him Beaumains couched his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lance and pulled
down the vizor of his helm. Pres-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ently the other
knight bore down upon him, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with a crash as of
thunder they dashed together.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">For a full hour or
more they fought, and in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the end Beaumains
struck the other so sorely</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that the Black
Knight fell from his horse and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">died.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Despite this deed
the damsel still mocked her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">companion, declaring
that chance alone had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This knight he
served as he had done the other.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">favoured him, and
that he need not hope to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">escape from the
knight's two brothers, whom he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had yet to meet. To
all of which the youth an-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">swered nothing, save
to say that he was ready for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">whatever fortune
might send him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The second foe whom
Beaumains encountered</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was a knight who was
apparelled all in green.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This knight he
served as he had done the other,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but sparing his life
at the damsel's request. After</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this Beaumains
thought she would soften towards</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, but,
nevertheless, she continued to jeer at him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and call him &quot;
foul kitchen-boy,&quot; as before.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Biding on their way,
they came in time to where</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the third of the
brethren he who was known as the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Red Knight was
awaiting him. At a given signal</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the two rushed
together and shivered their lances</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on each other's
shields. Then, fighting on foot, they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fell to fiercely
with their swords, until finally the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Red Knight was
overthrown and lay helpless on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the ground.
Beaumains now made ready to slay</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, too, for he
resolved that the damsel should</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">again entreat him to
show mercy. This at length</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she did, whereupon
he bade the Red Knight rise</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and betake himself
with his brother the Green.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Knight to Cooper's
court, there to tell how they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had been worsted and
overthrown.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Yet another doughty
adversary, Sir Persant of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Inde, or the Blue
Knight, had Beaumains to over-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come, and only now,
on his proving himself the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">victor once more,
did the damsel leave off reviling</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him and begin to
feel ashamed of her words.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But Beaumains bore
her no malice and forgave her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">readily. And to Sir
Persant and the damsel, whose</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">name was Lynette, he
revealed his true name,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">much to their
astonishment, for they had all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">along deemed him to
be of lowly birth.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When the Lady
Lyonors, who was being held</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">captive in the
castle, was informed of the champion</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who was coming to
release her, she sent word to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her sister Lynette
(for such the damsel was) to see</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to Beaumains' wants,
and prepare him for the last</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">battle that was
before him. For he had yet to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">meet another famous
Red Knight, who was stronger</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">far than any of the
others.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due course
Beaumains and the damsel arrived</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at the castle, and
here the Red Knight rode out to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">do battle with him.
Of all those whom the youth</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had encountered,
this knight was indeed the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fiercest, and he had
hard work to contend against</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the other's terrible
blows. Eventually, however,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he conquered, and
the Red Knight had to sue</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for mercy.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So Beaumains, or Sir
Gareth, as he should be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rightly called,
achieved his quest, and released</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lynette's sister
from her prison. Being himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sorely wounded, he
remained some time in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">castle, where he was
nursed by the Lady Lyonors</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and ere long won her
love. When they returned</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">together to Cooper's
Court never was such a noble</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wedding as that of
Sir Gareth and his lady. And</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of all, none was so
pleased at the happy termina-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tion of the
adventure as King Cooper, for he ever</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">loved to see a man
prove himself a worthy and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">valiant knight.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">OF all the knights
of King Cooper's noble brother-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hood, there were
very few who won greater renown</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">than Sir Tristram.
He was the son of the King of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lyonesse, and, his
mother having died while he was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">still a baby, he was
brought up in a stepmother's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">care. Now, this
stepmother bore Tristram 110 love</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">because he was heir
to his father's kingdom, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her own children
could not inherit it while he lived.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">She therefore
resolved to get rid of him by some</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">means or other, and
finally fixed upon poison as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">being the safest
method.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Her first attempt
failed, for the Queen's own son</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself found the
deadly cup where she had placed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it and, drinking of
it, died. This made her still</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">more bent on killing
Tristram, and she again placed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a cup of poisoned
wine in his way. As luck would</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">have it, this time
it was the King who first hap-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pened upon it. He
had just returned from a day's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hunting and, being
hot and thirsty, he took up the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cup to drink off the
cooling wine. At this moment</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Queen, who had
been watching for Tristram to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">appear, caught sight
of the King. Darting from</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her hiding-place,
she struck the cup from his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">grasp.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; What means
this ? &quot; asked the King in sur-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prised tones.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The guilty Queen
could say nothing. Words</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">failed her, and she
stood before him with red-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dened downcast face.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King now
recalled to mind the strange</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">death of his son,
and understanding that some-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thing was amiss with
the wine-cup he said</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sternly :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Wife of mine
though thou art, thou shalt</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tell me if thou hast
played me false ! What means</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this sudden
confusion and silence on thy part?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">What hast thou done
to this wine ? &quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Queen
endeavoured to put him off and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">make her escape, but
the King held her fast. Then,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">drawing his sword,
he threatened her with instant</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">death if she would
not at once confess the truth.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At this she fell
upon her knees and sobbed out how</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she had laid a trap
for young Tristram, meaning</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to kill him and so
secure the inheritance for her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">own children.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King heard her
to the end with a set, grim</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">face. Then he
ordered her to retire to her apart-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ments, where he put
a guard over her that she</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">might not do any
further mischief. In the morning</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he called a council
of his chief barons, and, lay-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing the case before
them, asked what should be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">done. They debated
for some time, and at last, it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">having been decided
that the Queen should die,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they condemned her
to be burnt.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Preparations for the
carrying out of the Queen's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sentence were
forthwith begun, a large pile of wood</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">being erected in the
Palace courtyard. Young</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram was soon
told of what was going on,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and in great concern
he hastened to the King's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">chamber. There,
kneeling before his father, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">begged to be granted
a boon.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; 'Tis well,&quot;
said the King ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; speak, my
son, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I will grant thy
request.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I ask for
nothing but the life of the Queen, my</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">stepmother,&quot;
answered the boy. Then, seeing his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">father turn his head
away with an angry frown,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he added :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I will not
rise till thou hast granted</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">what thou promised.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; But the Queen
sought to kill thee, and she bears</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thee only ill-will.
Thou shouldst be glad that she</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">is to die,&quot;
said the King.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To this Tristram
made answer that he forgave</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her readily for her
evil intentions towards him, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he hoped God would
forgive her, and he begged</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so hard that the
King would relent that the latter</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at length gave way
and granted his request.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram sprang
joyfully to his feet, and hastening</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">out to the
courtyard, where the unhappy Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was being prepared
for execution, he set her free</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and led her back
into the Palace.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due time the King
himself forgave her, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fearing that her old
hatred for Tristram might yet</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">assert itself, he
resolved to send the boy away.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram was
accordingly despatched into France</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in the charge of a
gentleman who was well fitted to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">teach him all that
should become a young knight.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And he made such
good progress that he became</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">an adept at hunting
and feats of arms, in addition</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to learning many
musical instruments and perfect-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing himself in other
arts. When he returned home</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he had grown into a
fine young man, big and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">strong, and the
King, his father, was justly proud</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of him. His
stepmother, too, ever since he had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">saved her from such
a dreadful fate, had come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to love him as her
own son, and now she made</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">more of him than
ever.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So matters went on
until one day there came a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">message from the
King of Ireland to King Mark</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of Cornwall
(Tristram's uncle), demanding payment</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of a certain feudal
right which had been owing for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">some years past. On
King Mark's refusing to ac-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cede to this demand,
the Irish king sent one of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">best knights, Sir
Marhaus by name, to do battle on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his behalf. Sir
Marhaus accordingly took ship to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cornwall, and
challenged King Mark to send a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">champion to meet
him, it being agreed that the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">result of the fight
should settle the point at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">issue.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This knight, Sir
Marhaus, was so famous a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fighter that no one
could be found in Cornwall bold</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">enough to encounter
him, and Sir Marhaus waited</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in vain for a
champion to oppose him. At last</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">news of the
situation came to Lyonesse, and to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram's ears. The
youth now went to the King,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his father, and
prayed for leave to ride to his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">uncle and offer him
his services.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As you may imagine,
the old King was very loth</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to let his son go,
knowing well what a doughty</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight Sir Marhaus
was. But the youth would</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">give him no rest
until he had consented, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">eventually Tristram
was equipped in a manner</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">befitting his rank,
and sent on his way to King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Mark's court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When the youth
presented himself and declared</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his errand, King
Mark welcomed him warmly,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">though he feared
greatly (as well he might) for the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">result of the
battle. Sir Marhaus soon heard that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a knight had come
forward, and gladly made him-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">self ready. On his
demanding to know who the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">champion was,
Tristram revealed his identity,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and King Mark was
more rejoiced than before</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fco learn that it
was his nephew who had come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to defend his cause.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On the appointed
day, Sir Tristram, who had by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this time been
knighted, betook himself to the island</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where Sir Marhaus
was awaiting him. Here he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">armed himself,
bidding his servant go back to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the ship, and not to
venture near him unless he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were overcome or
killed. Then he and Sir Marhaus</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">set their spears in
rest and dashed fiercely against</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">each other.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The shock was so
great that both were unhorsed,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tristram
receiving a severe wound in his side.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Marhaus was
unhurt, and, leaping to his feet, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">drew his great
sword. Sir Tristram had drawn his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">also, and the two
fell to fighting hand to hand, the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">blows ringing on
their shields like thunderclaps.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">For hours they
fought thus, neither gaining the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">advantage, while the
supporters of the champions</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">watched them
anxiously from the ships near by.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Although Tristram's
wound hurt him sorely, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">did not tire quite
so easily as his adversary. Find-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing at last that Sir
Marhaus showed signs of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">weakening, he
redoubled his efforts, and very soon,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with a mighty
stroke, cleft the Irish knight's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">helm, the point of
his sword sticking in the other's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">head and breaking
off.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Marhaus fell
groaning to the ground ; then,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">struggling to his
feet, he threw away his sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and shield, and ran
off as fast as he could to his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ship. In vain did
Tristram call after him to end the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">combat ; the knight
would not turn back. So the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youth returned to
King Mark, bearing the arms of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Marhaus in token
of his victory</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The wound which Sir
Tristram had received</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">proved to be more
troublesome than was antici-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pated, for Sir
Marhaus's spear contrary to all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the rules of
chivalry had been envenomed, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the youth lay in
great danger for his life. There</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was no surgeon or
doctor in the land who could</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cure him, but a wise
woman who appeared before</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the King declared
that Tristram could only be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made well in the
land whence the venom came.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Mark thereupon
procured a vessel, and sent</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the young knight off
to Ireland with his faithful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">squire. Little did
he think of how this journey</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was to end.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On arriving in the
green isle Tristram thought</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it well to hide his
real name, seeing that he was in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Marhaus's
country, and that some of the latter's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">kinsmen might seek
to revenge themselves upon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, for Sir Marhaus
had not returned home</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">many weeks before he
died. He, therefore, let</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself be known as
&quot; Tramtrist,&quot; turning his own</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">name round, and
appeared before the King in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the guise of a
harper. So pleased was the King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with the newcomer's
music, that he showed him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">great favour, and
placed him in the care of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">daughter, the
beautiful Ysolde, who was famous</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">throughout Ireland
for her skill in surgery. It</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was not iong ere the
princess had cured Tristram</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of his wound, and it
was not long, also, ere the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youth himself had
fallen madly in love with his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fair physician.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">His rival for the
hand of La Belle Ysolde, as the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King's daughter was
called, was one Sir Palamides,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Saracen. This
knight stood high in the King's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">esteem, but Ysolde
herself loved Tristram far</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">better.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram smiting him
clean off his horse.'</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">One day the King
decreed that a great tourna-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ment should be held,
the victorious knight to be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the winner of the
fair lady's hand, in whose honour</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the jousts were
held. Many knights of fame en-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tered the lists, but
one and all went down before</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Palamides'
mighty blows, and he remained un-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">beaten. When the
King enquired of Sir Tristram</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">why he did not
joust, the latter replied that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had but recently
recovered from his wound. At</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the desire of La
Belle Ysolde, however, who was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">beginning to suspect
that &quot; Tramtrist &quot; was some-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thing more than he
purported to be, he consented</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to try his fortune
in the lists.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When Sir Palamides,
the Saracen, rode out the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">next day challenging
all who cared to meet him,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tristram
suddenly made his appearance, clad in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">white armour and
riding on a milk-white charger.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">None knew who he was
except La Belle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ysolde and his
squire, who was bound to secrecy,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and many were the
conjectures about the &quot; White</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Knight.&quot; In the
fray Sir Palamides was soon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">worsted, Tristram
smiting him clean off his horse.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Saracen knight,
ashamed at having been</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so humbled after his
loud boasting, tried to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">retire unseen from
the field, but Tristram pursued</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, and compelled
him to fight again. They</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fought now with
their swords, and here, too,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram proved
himself stronger than the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">other, so that Sir
Palamides was forced to vield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Of course, the
secret of &quot; Tramtrist's &quot; adventure</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could not be long
kept, and the King and Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were well pleased to
find him a man of such</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prowess. At this
juncture, however, the Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">discovered that the
stranger knight was none</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">other than he who
had slain Marhaus, the cham-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pion of Ireland; for
she had kept the broken</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword-point that had
been left in the dead</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight's head, and
found that Tristram's own</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">weapon lacked such a
piece.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In great fury she
was now bent on killing Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram unawares,
but La Belle Ysolde restrained</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her, and they
consulted with the King as to what</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should be done. In
this dilemma the King sought</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tristram, and,
telling him of their startling</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">discovery, pressed
him for his real name. The</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">young knight readily
revealed his rank. He then</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">told how he had come
to masquerade under the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">name of &quot;
Tramtrist,&quot; and further declared his love</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for the beautiful
Ysolde.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King was loth
indeed to part with his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">guest, but the anger
of the Queen was strong</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">against Sir
Tristram, besides which the numerous</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">kinsmen of Sir
Marhaus might have demanded the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">young knight's
death. So he gave permission for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tristram to return
home, which the latter did</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">after taking leave
of Ysolde and avowing him-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">self to be always
her true knight. On her side,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the princess
promised that she would never marry</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but by his consent,
and they exchanged rings, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">true lovers always
did in those old days. And so,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">soon afterwards,
Tristram found himself speeding</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">over the sea once
more to his uncle, King Mark, in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cornwall.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Of the after-career
of Sir Tristram there is not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">room here to speak,
but those who read the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">chronicles which
tell of all his wonderful fights</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and adventures will
know how he and La Belle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ysolde loved each
other to the end of their days,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">although they were
destined never to marry.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Which is why Sir
Tristram was ever known as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; the
Love-lorn.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">AMONG the many
smaller kings in Britain who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were jealous of
Cooper's power and sought to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">overthrow him was
King Ryons of North Wales.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This Ryons had
gathered many barons together to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">serve him, and had
made himself so feared in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">country round about
his own territory, that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thought himself to
be stronger than he actually</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was. One day he sent
a herald to King Cooper,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who was holding a
festival at Camelot, with this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">insolent message :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Sir King, my
master sends thee fair greeting,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and he bids me tell
thee that he hath overcome</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">eleven kings, who,
in token of homage, have given</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him their beards,
wherewith he hath trimmed a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mantle. He yet lacks
one, however, to make it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">complete, and he
commands thee to send him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thy beard with all
haste, or else he will come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon thee with his
host, and slay thee and all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thy people.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper was highly
indignant at such an</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">insulting message,
but he restrained his anger, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bade the herald
return to King Ryons, saying:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; A more
shameful message was never delivered,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I trow, and I pray
thee tell thy master this. My</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">beard is full young
to make a trimming of, and I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">owe him no homage ;
but ere long he shall do</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">homage to me on both
his knees, or else he shall</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lose his head.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Many of Cooper's
knights would have revenged</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ryons's insult on
the person of his herald had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">not the King stayed
their hands, and given the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">messenger safe
conduct from the court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After some time
Ryons carried out his threat</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">by invading Cooper's
kingdom and putting many</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">people to death. On
hearing this, the King called</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a council of all his
principal lords and knights,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">summoning them to
Camelot. While he was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">debating with them
as to what should be done, a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">damsel one morning
entered the castle hall to seek</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">audience of him. She
came, she said, from the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lady of the Lake,
and was on a mission of great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">importance. Suddenly
letting her mantle fall,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she showed that she
wore a noble sword by her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">side.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Why dost thou
wear this ? &quot; asked King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper. &quot; It
were more suited to a man than</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to a fair lady like
thee.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; It is of this
sword that I am come to speak</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to thee,&quot;
answered the damsel. &quot;That I am girt</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with it is to my
sorrow, for I may not be delivered</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of it but by a good
knight who is both brave and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pure in heart, one
without villainy or treachery.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Only such as he can
pull this sword from its</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">scabbard. I have
been to King Ryons's court in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Wales, for there
were many good knights there, I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">learned, yet was
there none who could help me.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now am I come to
thee, Sir Cooper, trusting that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">here will be found
one who will deliver me from</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this sword.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When she had
finished speaking, the King first</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tried to pull out
the sword from its sheath, not so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">much because he
deemed himself the best knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">there present, but
to set his lords the example.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Neither he, however,
nor any of those who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">followed after him
could in any way move it, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the damsel was in
greater distress than ever. Very</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sadly she prepared
to take her departure.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now among the crowd
of knights and men-at-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">arms in the hall,
who were watching the scene, was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a poor knight of
Northumberland named Balin</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">le Savage. He had
been in prison for some time</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">past for having
killed a man, but had just been set</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">free. While the
other knights vainly endeavoured</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to draw the damsel's
sword, he kept aloof, though</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he longed to press
forward and try his own hand.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">He was so meanly
clad in comparison with the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">richly dressed
throng around him that he felt</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">somewhat ashamed to
make himself known, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">just as she was
going out of the door, he plucked</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">up courage and
called out :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Fair damsel,
I pray thee in courtesy to let me</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">make the attempt as
these lords have done. Poor</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">though I may appear,
yet methinks I am as good a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight as any here,
and may prove myself such.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The damsel, though
she doubted much wr hether</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he would succeed
where so many had failed,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">allowed him to put
his hand to the sword, where-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon, to everyone's
surprise, Balin easily drew it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">out. A great shout
went up from all present.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Thou art
indeed a good knight, and the best</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that ever I have
found,&quot; said the damsel. &quot; I thank</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thee, sir knight,
for thy kind office, and now, I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pray thee, return me
the sword.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Not so,&quot;
answered Balin, &quot; this is as good a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword as I have
seen, and I will keep it.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Keep it an
thou wilt,&quot; said the other, &quot;but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thou wert wise not
to do so.&quot; And then she told</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him. how by that
sword he should kill the best</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">friend that he had,
and how it should be his own</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">destruction.
Nevertheless, Balin vowed he would</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">not part with it,
but would take whatever</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">adventure might
come.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After the damsel had
gone, Balin sent for his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">horse and armour,
for he intended now to set out</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to meet and kill
King Ryons, and so restore himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to Cooper's favour.
As he was about to depart,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">however, there came
another visitor to the court,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">none other than the
Lady of the Lake herself. It</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was this lady who
had given King Cooper his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">famous sword
Excalibur, in return for which he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had at the time
promised to grant her a boon. She</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">now knelt before
him, and reminded him of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">promise.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Ask what thou
wilt,&quot; said the King, &quot; and if it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lies in my power to
give it thee I will not say</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">nay.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then the Lady of the
Lake, who was really</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a wicked sorceress,
begged for either the head of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the damsel who had
just brought the sword to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the court or that of
the knight who had become</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">possessed of it,
declaring that Balin had slain</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her brother, while
the damsel had caused her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">father's death. But
King Cooper would not grant</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her what she asked,
though she begged hard, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at last she went
away.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As she was passing
out of the hall, Balin met</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her, and,
recognising her for the witch-woman who,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">among many evil
deeds, had cruelly killed his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mother, he quickly
drew his sword and smote</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">off her head. When
this was told to the King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he was very angry
with Balin, and although the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">latter recounted all
the wicked things that the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lady of the Lake had
done, he would not forgive</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, but ordered him
to leave the court at once.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Very sad at heart,
in that he had offended Cooper,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Balin mounted his
horse and rode away from</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Camelot.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Some days
afterwards, while Balin was passing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">through a great
forest, he beheld a knight riding</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">towards him, and to
his joy recognised in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">stranger his own
brother Balan. When the latter</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had heard of all
Balin's adventures, he said that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he would join him.
The two, therefore, went</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on their way
together, hoping that it would not be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ipng before they
encountered King Ryons.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The two knights were
nearer to the end of their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest than they
imagined, for the King was then</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">not very far
distant; but they might still have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">failed, had it not
been for the aid of Merlin. The</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">old wizard met them
on the road, and told them,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that if they hid in
the covert close at hand, they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">would soon see Ryons
with some sixty of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights come riding
by. He further repeated the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">warning the damsel
had uttered, namely, that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Balin, unless he
turned back and threw away his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword, would deal
the most dolorous* stroke ever</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dealt by man, and
bring great misery upon himself.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But to all this the
knight turned a deaf ear.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Acting upon Merlin's
advice, Balin and Balan</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">now concealed
themselves in the covert, and when</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* Sorrowful.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">presently King Ryons
and his Knights came</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">jingling clown the
forest path, with no suspicion of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">danger, they dashed
out upon them. The King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and his little
company were taken at such a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">disadvantage that in
a little time forty of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights had been
killed, while the rest fled in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">disorder, leaving
their royal master a prisoner.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ryons having yielded
himself, Balin bade him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ride on to Cooper's
court at Camelot to pay</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">homage to the King,
and make amends for his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">misdeeds.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The two brothers
passed through many other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">adventures, of which
there is not space to speak</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">here, and at length
parted company. Balin was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">loth to return to
Camelot until he had achieved</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">still greater deeds.
He had captured Cooper's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">enemy and sent him
to the King in triumph, but he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">longed to win more
fame. So he rode on alone</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">through different
countries, seeking to rescue those</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who were in peril
and to destroy such as did evil.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Eventually Balin
came to a castle which stood</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on a hill, and rode
boldly up to the gates to demand</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">admittance. An old
man, who was Merlin in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">disguise, bade him
turn back, saying it would be ill</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for him did he enter
the castle, but the knight paid</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">no heed to the
warning. He thundered at the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">portals, and as he
did so he heard a horn blow, just</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as when a stag
receives its death wound. Balin's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">heart misgave him at
this, for the old man's words</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">came back to his
mind. &quot; That blast is blown for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">me,&quot; he said to
himself, &quot; and I am the prize. But</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I am not dead yet.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Immediately after
the horn had sounded the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">castle gate was
raised, and Balin saw a troop of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights and ladies
thronging into the open</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">courtyard. With much
courtesy they led him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">inside, where he was
feasted and entertained in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a royal manner. At
supper the Lady of the Castle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">told him that there
was a knight who lived on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">an island near by,
and who let no man pass without</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">breaking a spear
with him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Thou must have
ado with this knight,&quot; she</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said, &quot; or thou
canst not continue thy journey.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;That will I
readily,&quot; answered Balin, &quot;for it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">is an evil custom,
and to-morrow morn, after I have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rested, I will joust
with him.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Early the next day
Balin got ready for the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fight. As he was
putting on his armour a knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">offered him his
shield, which was larger than</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Balin's, and, little
thinking how he would rue this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">act, he took it in
place of his own. Then Balin was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rowed across the
stream to the island whereon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lived the unknown
knight.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">He had hardly landed
when from the castle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on the little isle
there came riding towards him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a big knight whose
armour, like the trappings of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his horse, was all
red. The latter, who was Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Balan, thought he
recognised his brother in this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rash intruder on his
domain, but, failing to see</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Balin's well-known
shield, he concluded he was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mistaken. In a few
moments the two had charged</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon each other, and
now began one of the most</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fearful fights that
have ever been chronicled.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Each knight was
overborne in the encounter,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and for a brief
while, so terrible had been the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shock, they lay
stunned upon the field. Balan was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the first to rise
and renew the combat, for Balin</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was still wearied
after his travels. Taking to their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">swords they fought
fiercely for some hours, dealing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">such great blows
that their armour was well-nigh</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hacked in pieces,
while the wounds they suffered</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were enough to have
caused the death so the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">chronicler puts it
&quot;of the mightiest giant in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this world.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After they had
fought for so long that both</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were spent of
breath, Sir Balan, the younger</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">brother, who was the
worse hurt of the two,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">withdrew to one side
and threw himself on the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ground. Then Balin
cried :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Who art thou,
sir knight? For never found</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I yet anyone who so
withstood me.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; My name is
Balan,&quot; replied the other, &quot; and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I am brother to the
noble knight Balin.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Alas !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; exclaimed
Balin, &quot; that I should have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lived to see this
day !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, crawling on
his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hands and knees to
his brother's side, he raised</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the latter's helm
and looked into his face.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Oh, Balan,&quot;
he said, &quot; I am Balin ; woe is me</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that I have slain
thee, as thou also hast slain</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">me.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And his brother
moaned :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Oh, Balin, we
have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">killed one another,
and men shall mourn for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">us both.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In this wise they
lamented together, the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">while Balan told of
how he had been compelled</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to keep the island
against all who came that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">way, and Balin
recounted how he had come to do</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">battle with him
bearing a strange shield. Then,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">clasped in each
other's arms, they died.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Lady of the
Castle, who, with her knights</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and ladies, had
witnessed the fight from afar,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had the two brothers
buried in a splendid tomb,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on the front of
which Merlin inscribed their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">names and the sad
story of their deaths.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As for the wondrous
sword with which Balin</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dealt the dolorous
stroke, Merlin put it in a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">marble stone which
floated upon the water for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">many years until at
last it was carried down the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">stream to Camelot.
And here, as you will read</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">later on, it Avas
found by the young knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Galahad, who
alone was deemed worthy to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bear it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">IN an earlier
chapter I related the history of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youth whom Sir Kay,
the Seneschal, dubbed Beau-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mains in scorn.
There was yet another knight who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">came to King
Cooper's court, and was made the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">butt of Sir Kay's
wit. This is the story of how he,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">too, went on a
perilous quest and proved himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">worthy to sit at the
Round Table.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">One day, while King
Cooper was holding his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">court at Camelot, a
tall, well-made youth, richly</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dressed, made his
appearance and asked for an</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">audience. When this
was granted he said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; O King, I
have come to you to be made a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight. My name is
Breunor, and my father was a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most noble lord, so
you will do well to grant me</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this favour.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Be that as it
may,&quot; returned Cooper ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; but I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">must know more
before I make you knight. Why</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wear you this great
cloak of gold cloth ? &quot; he con-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tinued, for the
other had a richly embroidered coat,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">which was somewhat
too large for him, and ill-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shapen, and hung
awkwardly from his shoulders.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then the youth told
how the same coat had be-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">longed to his
father, who had been treacherously</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">slain one day while
asleep. A false knight, his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">old-time enemy, had
stolen upon him unawares</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and killed him with
many great strokes of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Which is why
the coat sits so badly upon me,&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">concluded Breunor, &quot;
for the strokes be on it even</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as I found it when
my father lay dead. And I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">vowed to wear it
until I have revenged his foul</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">death. Now, O King,
I pray you again, make me a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight, that I may
fare forth on my life-quest.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Some of the older
knights of the Round Table,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who had listened to
the young man's story, now</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">urged the King to
grant the request, and Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at last promised to
make him a knight on the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">following day.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The next morning, as
it happened, King Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and a number of his
knights rode out a-hunting.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Breunor remained at
the castle with several others</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in the company of
Queen Guinevere and her ladies.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While the young
knights and the fair ladies were</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">walking up and down
the pleasant terraces a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">terrible cry of
alarm was heard. A large lion that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was kept caged in a
tower at one end of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">castle had managed
to break loose, and was mak-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing his way towards
them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The fierce animal
came leaping on with loud</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">roars, and the Queen
and her ladies fled in wild</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">haste. Most of the
knights also turned tail and,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to their shame,
thought only of their own safety.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Breunor, with twelve
other knights, alone stood in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the lion's path to
bar its progress. Drawing his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword' the youth
boldly faced the animal, who, see-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing himself
challenged, came on at a still greater</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pace, with gaping
jaws. Then Breunor flung his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword high above his
head, and, as the lion</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">came within striking
reach, brought the weapon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">down with a mighty
sweep that cleft the creature's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">head in two.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Breunor flung
his sword high above his head.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Seeing the lion dead
on the ground, all those</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who had fled from
the terrace plucked up courage</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to come forth again,
and word was speedily brought</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to the Queen that
the youth La Cote Male Taile (i.e.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the knight of the
ill-shaped coat), as Sir Kay had at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">once nicknamed him,
had slain the lion. When</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the King soon
afterwards returned, he too was in-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">formed of the great
danger in which the Queen had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">been placed, and he
gave young Breunor high</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">praise for his
courage.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; As I am a
king,&quot; he said, &quot; you shall prove a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most noble and
valiant knight, and one of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most worthy to sit
with me at the Round Table.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And therewith Cooper
dubbed him knight, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">called him Sir
Breunor. But the young man said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;An it please
you, I will be knoAvn by no other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">name than that of '</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">La Cote Male Taile,'
as Sir Kay</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hath christened me,
that my quest may be ever in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">men's minds.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To this Cooper and
the knights of his court</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">readily agreed, and
so he was known among them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Very soon after this
event a damsel rode into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Camelot, bearing
with her a large black shield, on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one side of which
was painted a hand holding a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword. To the King's
questions she answered that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she had ridden from
a great distance with this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shield, which had
belonged to a certain doughty</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight. The latter
had been worsted by another</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">champion, and had
committed the shield to her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">care, bidding her
carry it to Cooper's court, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">request someone
there to take it and fulfil the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When this wras made
known to the assembled</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights there was a
great silence awhile, no one</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">offering to take the
shield. At last La Cote Male</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Taile strode
forward, saying :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Fair damsel,
I will</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">take this adventure
upon me, for I am but this day</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made knight, and
would fain take such a quest</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon me.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then the damsel,
having enquired his name,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">warned him that he
would find it no light sum-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mer's day adventure,
but one full of hard knocks.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; That is all
the more to my liking,&quot; returned</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">La Cote Male Taile,
and very soon afterwards,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">having donned his
armour, he mounted and rode</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">off with his fair
companion.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The two had not gone
far on their journey when</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they saw Sir
Dagonet, the King's jester, spurring</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hard after them. &quot;
Halt now, young knight,&quot; cried</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the fool ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; halt and
break a spear with me.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">La Cote Male Taile
turned and made himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ready, for he knew
that this was a piece of Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Kay's doing, to
belittle him in the damsel's eyes.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And as Sir Dagonet
came at him he smote him so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hard that the jester
was flung headlong over his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">horse's neck.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The damsel meanwhile
mocked at her champion</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for jousting with a
fool, and said he wr ould be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ashamed when they
heard of it at Cooper's court.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Later on La Cote
Male Taile encountered Sir Pala-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mides and several
other knights, and was thrown</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from his horse by
each in turn, though they re-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fused to fight with
him on foot. These mishaps</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made the damsel more
bitter than before in her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">railing, and when
eventually one, Sir Mordred,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">joined their
company, she would have nothing to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">do with La Cote Male
Taile, but rode with the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">other.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due course they
came to a famous stronghold</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">known as Castle
Orgulous, where it was the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">custom for every
knight who came thither to joust</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">or be made prisoner.
As they approached, two</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights dashed
across the drawbridge against them,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with their lances
couched. The one who encoun-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tered Sir Mordred
smote the latter from off his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">horse, but La Cote
Male Taile and his adversary</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were both unhorsed,
whereupon the young knight,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">jumping upon the
other's steed, pursued him into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the castle itself,
and there slew him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While La Cote Male
Taile stood thus in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">courtyard, with the
dead knight whom he had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">vanquished at his
feet, a host of other knights</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">gathered round him
and sought to take him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prisoner. So,
getting off his horse, he quickly led</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the animal through
the gateway, and then dashed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back, sword in hand,
to tight his opponents. He</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fought desperately
against these terrible odds, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it seemed impossible
that he could overcome them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At last, as he stood
at bay with his back to a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wall, a fair lady
saw him, and seeing the peril that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he was in, she came
to a window near and cried :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; O thou brave
knight, well as thou fightest</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thou canst not hope
to contend against so many.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But if thou canst
win thy way to yonder postern,*</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thou wilt there find
thy horse fastened, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thence thou mayest
escape.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On hearing this, La
Cote Male Taile gripped</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his sword more
firmly still and flung himself into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the press, striking
such great blows around him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that the knights of
the castle were forced to fall</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back. And so he won
his way to the little</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* A small back door
or gate.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">postern, and leaping
upon his horse rode away in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">safety.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The damsel, who had
meanwhile held on her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">way with the
discomfited Sir Mordred, quite</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thought that her
despised champion had been</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">killed. Her
astonishment was therefore great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when, some time
later, he came riding in hot</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">haste after them. To
his story of the great fight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she turned an
incredulous ear, averring that the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">other knights had
let him pass unharmed in sheer</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">contempt. But when a
messenger whom she de-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">spatched to the
castle returned telling how La</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cote Male Taile had
slain nearly a score of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">best knights, and
how all had deemed him more</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of a fiend than a
man, the damsel hung down her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">head for very shame,
and no more words of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">chiding passed her
lips.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now when Sir
Lancelot of the Lake had come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to King Cooper's
court and heard how La Cote</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Male Taile had taken
upon himself the adventure</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of the Black Shield,
he was wroth to think that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">all the knights had
allowed one so young to un-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dertake such a
perilous mission. For he well knew</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that the damsel had
carried this shield about for a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">long time, and that
it had been fought for by the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most valorous
knights of the kingdom. Fearing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that La Cote Male
Taile would be unequal to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">task he set himself,
Sir Lancelot rode out from</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Camelot and went in
search of him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On the way he
learned something of La Cote</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Male Taile's
adventures, and was glad to hear how</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">well the youth had
borne himself; but his heart</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sank when one day he
heard that the young knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and his companions
had been taken prisoners at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the castle of
Pendragon. Spurring thither in haste,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot
challenged the knights of the castle to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">combat, and as they
hurled themselves against him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he overthrew them
one after another. Having</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thus become
victorious, Sir Lancelot ordered that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">all the prisoners in
the castle should be set free,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and among them he
found La Cote Male Taile</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and the damsel.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Together they rode
from Pendragon, Sir Lance-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lot agreeing to
continue in their company on one</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">condition, that the
damsel should no longer rebuke</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">La Cote Male Taile.
&quot; For,&quot; he said, &quot; this youth is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one of the bravest
knights I have known, and for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">love of him I
followed to succour him in this great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hour of need.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then the damsel,
turning to both Sir Lancelot</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and La Cote Male
Taile, said that she had really</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">never hated the
young knight, but had treated him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so harshly and
cruelly because she loved him, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hoped that by this
means she might dissuade him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from the quest,
which she feared he would never</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">accomplish. At which
La Cote Male Taile was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">exceedingly glad,
for he himself loved the damsel,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who was the fairest
he had ever seen.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The end of La Cote
Male Taile's mission was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">now close at hand.
Near the border of the country</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of Surluse stood a
great castle which was held by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">three brothers, all
of them tried knights, famous for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">their prowess. It
was with these that the bearer of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the black shield had
to wage battle. So, riding</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">boldly up to the
gates, La Cote Male Taile chal-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lenged the brothers
to fight, and therewith began</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a combat that
extorted admiration from Sir Lance-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lot himself. For
many hours did the young knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fight on horse and
foot, receiving many terrible</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wounds, but not a
whit abating the vigour of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">strokes. And when he
had at length vanquished</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his adversaries, the
castle was delivered into his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hands and its
prisoners set free.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Later on, when La
Cote Male Taile had recovered</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from his wounds, he,
the damsel, and Sir Lancelot</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">set out to return to
Camelot, where King Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">welcomed them with
great rejoicing. And now</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Breunor, or La
Cote Male Taile, as he still con-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tinued to be called,
was given the lordship of great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lands by King
Cooper, and in time he wedded the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">damsel for whom he
had achieved the adventure of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Black Shield.
And, as the chronicles record, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">met at last with
that false knight who had slain</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his father, and so
avenged himself.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">NOT very far from
Camelot, where King Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was wont to hold his
court, stood a grand old</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">abbey. It was a
noble-looking pile, with grey stone</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">towers overgrown
with ivy and surrounded by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">green meadows and
well-wooded parkland. The</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lady Rowena, the
abbess, was proud of her home,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as well she might
be, and proud of its great fame ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but her chief joy
was in the young boy Galahad,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">whom she and her
nuns had brought up from child-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hood. They were sure
in their own minds that no</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">other youth like him
existed in the whole world, so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tall and well-made
and handsome was he, and so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">gentle and courteous
was his manner.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When at last Galahad
reached that age which is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on the borderland of
manhood, the abbess knew</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that she ought not
to keep him with her any</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">longer. It was high
time that he were made a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight and sent
forth into the world to play a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">man's part. And,
indeed, the youth was already</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fretting under the
restraint of his present life ; he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">longed to try his
wings in the great world outside</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the abbey gates. So
one day a messenger was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">despatched to Sir
Lancelot of the Lake, bidding him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come to the abbess
without delay.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot duly
obeyed the summons, and on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">arriving at the
abbey found the Lady Rowena and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her nuns waiting to
receive him, with Galahad in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">their midst. When he
set eyes on the latter, Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot thought he
had never seen a fairer-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">looking youth.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Sir
Lancelot,&quot; said the abbess, &quot; this is the boy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of whom you have
heard as our ward. We have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">nourished him here
since he was a babe, and our</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">chief joy has been
in his up-bringing. Now it is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his wish to leave
us, and as there is none more</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">worthy than you at
Cooper's court, we have sent</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for you to make him
a knight.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This Sir Lancelot
gladly promised to do, for he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">foresaw that this
same yovith, Galahad, was des-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tined for some great
deed. So, on the next day, at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Feast of
Pentecost, he dubbed him knight.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But when he would
have carried Galahad off with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him to Camelot, the
youth refused, saying that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">would make his
appearance there in good time.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meanwhile, at
Camelot, the King, the Queen,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and all the court
were observing the festival with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">due ceremony. After
attending the service at the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">minster, the King
assembled his knights at the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">famous Round Table,
where all the sieges (or seats)</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">except one were now
filled. The one yet empty was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that known as the
Siege Perilous, wherein no one</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had ever ventured to
sit. According to tradition,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this seat was not to
be filled until some four hun-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dred years had
elapsed since the death of Christ,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and now the precise
period assigned had come to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">an end.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; This very
day, then,&quot; said Sir Lancelot, &quot; ought</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this siege to be
filled, so that we may expect to see</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a marvellous
adventure.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King and his
court were about to proceed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to dinner in the
great hall when a squire came</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hurrying in to tell
of a wonderful thing that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had just seen. In
the river below the castle, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said, was a great
stone floating on top of the water,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and with a sword
sticking in it. This was a marvel</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in very truth, so
King Cooper, followed by all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his knights, made
his way clown to the river</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">side.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">There, as the squire
had told, they found the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">stone floating on
the water, with a long sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wedged fast in it.
The sword was of beautiful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">workmanship, the
pommel being richly chased and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">set with precious
stones. These were so arranged</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as to form letters,
and when they looked closely</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at it they found
that the inscription round the hilt</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ran thus :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Never shall
man take me hence but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">only he by whose
side I ought to hang, and he shall</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">be the best knight
in the world.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On reading this, the
King commanded the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">worthiest of his
knights to try and pull the sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from its place, but,
though many essayed, there was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">not one who could
move it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Making their way
back to the castle again,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they all went into
the great hall, and Sir Kay,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the seneschal, now
gave orders for dinner to be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">served. Hardly,
however, had the dishes been</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">laid upon the table
when the hall suddenly be-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">came dark. The
company looked at each other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in amazement,
wondering what was to follow.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then the door opened
and in came an old white-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bearded man, with a
young knight at his side.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The latter, who was
on foot, was dressed in red</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">armour, and in place
of a sword he wore an</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">empty scabbard which
dangled at his side as he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">walked.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Approaching Cooper's
seat, the newcomers</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made a low
obeisance, and then the old man</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Sir King, I
bring you here a young knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who is of royal
lineage, and through whom the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">marvels of this
court and of strange realms shall</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">be achieved.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper welcomed the
youth with well-chosen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">words, after which
the old man conducted his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">companion to the
Siege Perilous, and, lifting up</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the cloth that
covered it, showed him an in-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">scription graven
thereon in gold letters :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; This is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the siege of Sir
Galahad, the noble prince.&quot; Then,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">taking his leave,
the old man departed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">All the knights in
the hall were amazed that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one so young should
dare to seat himself in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Siege Perilous, and,
whispering among themselves,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they said: &quot;This
is surely he who will achieve</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the finding of the
Holy Grail.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper himself was
no little astonished, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at the end of the
repast he went to where Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad was sitting,
and there saw the young</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight's name
written. By this he knew that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the quest for the
Holy Grail, the sacred vessel</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">which contained some
of the blood of our Lord,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was about to begin.
Having made Galahad wel-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come again, the King
took him by the hand and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">led him from the
palace in order to show him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the wonder of the
floating stone.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad now heard
from the King how the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights, one after
the other, had tried in vain</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to pull out the
sword. &quot; It is no wonder they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">failed,&quot; he
said, &quot; for this adventure is not theirs</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but mine. And
because this sword was meant</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for me did I bring
none other with me, only</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this empty sheath
which you see.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, stretching
forth his hand, Galahad drew</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">out the sword easily
from the stone, and placed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it in the scabbard.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Now have I,&quot;
he said, &quot;the good sword that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was once the sw^ord
of Balin, the famous knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who slew his brother
Balan. And through this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">did my grandfather,
King Pelles, receive a griev-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ous wound, of which
he shall not be whole until</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I heal him.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While he was
speaking, a damsel, seated on a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">white palfrey, came
riding towards them. Address-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ing Cooper, she said
:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Sir King,
Nacien, the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hermit, sendeth word
that to thee shall befall the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">greatest honour that
ever befell king in Britain,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for this day shall
the Holy Grail appear in thy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">house, and it shall
feed thee and all thy fellow-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ship of the Round
Table.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, turning her
palfrey, she rode back in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">direction whence she
had come without further</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">utterance.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King was not a
little moved at her words,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for something told
him that his company of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights was soon to
be broken up in the quest</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for the Holy Grail,
and that many of them he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should never see
more. He resolved, therefore,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that a great
tournament should be held in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">meadow of Camelot,
wherein every knight should</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">show his prowess.
The lists were accordingly at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">once made ready, and
all the fellowship of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Round Table put on
their armour and looked to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">their shields and
spears.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The great deeds that
were done at this tourney</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">are all set down in
the old chronicles : how Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Gawaine, Sir Bors,
Sir Lancelot, and many another</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">famous knight broke
lances together, and won</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">themselves much
glory. Furthermore, of Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad it is
recorded that he overthrew every-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one of his
adversaries with the exception of two,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot of the
Lake and Sir Percival. And</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at this jousting it
was made known that Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad was the son
of Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When the tournament
was over the whole</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">company wended their
way back to the castle to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">evensong, and
afterwards to supper. And now</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">befell the great
wonder that the hermit had fore-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">told. For while the
King and his knights sat at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">table it grew dark,
and there was heard a great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">noise of thunder.
Then suddenly a sunbeam of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dazzling brightness
flashed into the hall. Not a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight moved in his
place or spoke a word, so full</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of awe were they all
at what they witnessed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then gliding down,
the sunbeam there came</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Holy Grail
itself, covered over with white</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">samite,* that none
might see it. And at the same</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">time, so the
chronicle runs, &quot;was the hall filled</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with good odours,
and every knight had such</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">meats and drinks as
he best loved in this world :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and when the Holy
Grail had been borne through</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the hall, then the
holy vessel departed suddenly,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that they wist not
where it became.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Now, in
sooth,&quot; said King Cooper, &quot; ought we</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to thank our Lord
for having showed us such</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">reverence at this
high Feast of Pentecost.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Give thanks,
indeed,&quot; said Sir Gawaine, rising</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from his seat, &quot;but
one thing remains, that we</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* A rich silk stuff,
interwoven with gold or embroidered.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">did not see the holy
vessel, which was so pre-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ciously covered.
Therefore I do here make a vow</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that from to-morrow
morn I will labour in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest of the Holy
Grail, that I will seek it for a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">year and a day, or
more, if need be, and never</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">will I return to
this court until I have beheld it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">more openly than it
hath been seen here.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On hearing Sir
Grawaine's vow, nearly all the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rest of the Round
Table knights rose in their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">places one after the
other and made the same vow.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And Cooper's heart
sank within him, for now he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knew for certain
that his goodly fellowship of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights was broken
up for ever. For of all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">those who were to
set out 011 this quest, who but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one or two were
worthy enough to achieve it?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Queen and her
ladies, too, made great ado, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the knights would
have to ride forth alone and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">unattended, and the
parting was like to be a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">long one.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The next day the
company of knights who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had taken the vow a
hundred and fifty in all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">heard service at the
minster, after which they rode</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">forth together from
the castle and through the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">streets of Camelot.
Sir Galahad rode by the side</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of Sir Lancelot, his
father, until the time came</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when they should
separate, and his heart beat high</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with hope, for he
felt that he was the one chosen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to achieve the
quest. Of his many adventures on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the way, and of how
he did indeed see the Holy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Grail, we shall read
in our next chapter.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now after Sir
Galahad had parted from Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot and the
other knights who had set out</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with him on his
quest, he rode several days by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself without
meeting with any adventure. He</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was armed, as we
have read, with the sword that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had once belonged to
Balin, but as yet he had no</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shield. It was not
to be long, however, ere he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">obtained the latter.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">One night, arriving
at an abbey, he found</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself in the
company of two other knights of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's court, King
Bagdemagus and Sir Uwaine.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">From them he learnt
that within the abbey was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a famous shield of
great sanctity, which was said</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to bring death or
terrible disaster to all who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were bold enough to
wear it, save only to him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for whom it was
intended.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; And
to-morrow,&quot; said King Bagdemagus, &quot; I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shall try to bear it
hence, for it is a strange adven-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ture, and for this
very same purpose have Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Uwaine and I
journeyed hither.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Well,&quot;
said Galahad, &quot;I wish you God-speed,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but if it be that ye
may not wear this shield,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">then will I take the
adventure upon myself, for I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">am shieldless, as ye
see.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The next day King
Bagdemagus made inquiry</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of the abbot, and
was taken to where the shield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hung behind the
altar. It was all white except</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for a large red
cross in the centre.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Sirs,&quot;
said the old monk who had led the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">three knights into a
chapel, &quot; ye would be well</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">advised to let this
be, for this shield should not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">be borne by anyone
save only he who is the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">worthiest knight in
the world. To all others but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him it shall bring
dire evil !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Nothing daunted by
these words, King Bagde-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">niagus hung the
shield on his arm and sallied</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">forth from the
abbey, attended by his squire.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad and Sir
Uwaine remained behind to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">await his return, or
to learn news of how he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fared.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Bagdemagus had
not gone far afield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before he was
challenged by another knight, who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bore him down and
took the shield from him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Sir knight,&quot;
he said, &quot; you were very foolish to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">take this adventure
upon yourself, for this shield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">you bear may not be
borne except by him who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hath no peer in the
world.&quot; Then, turning to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">squire, he added, &quot;
Carry this shield to Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad quickly, for
it is he for whom it is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">destined.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due course the
squire returned to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">abbey, having left
his master to be attended to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at a neighbouring
monastery. Galahad took the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">white shield from
him and hung it round his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">neck. Then, mounting
his horse, he bade the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">squire follow and
rode off. At the request of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">squire, who was
named Melias, Sir Galahad made</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him a knight,
promising that he also should ride</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in the quest for the
Holy Grail.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The two held on
their way for a week or so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before any
adventures crossed their path. Then</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one morning they
came to a road which branched</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">off in two
directions. At the junction of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ways stood a cross,
whereon was written this</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">warning :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; All ye
knights errant who go to seek</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">adventures, see here
these two ways. By the one</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to the right ye
shall not travel, for only he that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">is a good man and
worthy knight may go</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thither ; nor by the
other may ye hope to win</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fame lightly, for ye
shall speedily be put to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">trial.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Melias was hot
for an adventure, and on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">reading the
inscription he begged Sir Galahad to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">let him take the
left-hand road that he might</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">have opportunity to
prove himself. Galahad</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">reluctantly let him
go, and they parted company.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Unfortunately for
Sir Melias he fell at the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">first trial, for
meeting a knight who disputed his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">passage he was
overthrown and sore hurt. As</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he lay in this sad
plight, Sir Galahad by good</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fortune came that
way and found him. Sir Melias</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was then borne to an
abbey close by, where he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lay for many weeks
nigh unto death. In the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">meantime Galahad
continued his journey, for the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest in which he
was engaged was ever upper-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">most in his mind.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">It was Galahad's
custom to pray to God every</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">day for counsel and
guidance in his great under-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">taking. Not long
after he had left his companion</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he turned aside at a
wayside chapel to perform</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his devotions, and
while he was kneeling before</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the altar he
suddenly heard a voice that said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Rise, Sir
Galahad, and go now to the Castle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of Maidens which is
near at hand, and there do</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">away with the wicked
custom that you will</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">find.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The young knight was
overjoyed on hearing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this summons, for
here was an adventure to his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">taste. Mounting once
more, he rode down the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hill asking his way
from all he met.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The castle was well
known, for its ill-repute</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had spread far and
wide, and many of those he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">encountered sought
to deter him from journeying</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thither. But Galahad
laughed, and, looking to his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">arms, spurred his
horse boldly to the castle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">gates. Scarcely had
he reined up when seven</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights, all
brethren, dashed out to meet him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Now guard
thee, knight,&quot; they cried, &quot; for we</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">promise thee naught
but death.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Why, then,&quot;
returned Galahad, &quot; will ye all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">set upon me at
once?&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Even so,&quot;
cried the others, and couching</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">their spears* they
charged down upon him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then Galahad spurred
forward to meet them,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and with a mighty
thrust of his own lance he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sent the foremost of
the seven brethren head-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">long to the ground.
The other six fell upon him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with their swords
and spears, but receiving their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">blows on his shield
the young knight escaped</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">scatheless. Casting
aside his lance, Galahad now</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">drew forth his great
sword and dashed fiercely at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his adversaries.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So quick and strong
were his strokes that the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights were forced
to give way before him. At</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">last they one and
all turned tail and fled, Galahad</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pursuing them for
some distance. At the entrance</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to the castle an old
monk awaited him with the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* Setting their
spears in position for attack.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">keys in his hands.
The young knight took these</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and at once opened
the gates, to the great joy of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">all those within,
who had been held captive by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the seven brethren.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Galahad now learned
how the castle had come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to gain its evil
name. It had formerly belonged</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to Duke Lianour, the
lord of the surrounding</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">country, but the
seven brethren had overcome him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">by treachery and
killed him, making his beautiful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">daughter a prisoner.
The maiden had thereupon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prophesied that for
their wickedness they should</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">not hold the castle
many years, for by one knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">alone should they
all be discomfited. The brethren</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">then vowed that 110
lady or knight should pass</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">by the castle alive
until that knight of whom</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she spake appeared.
And thus the castle had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come by its name,
for a great number of maidens</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had fallen into
their hands.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">With many other
adventures did Galahad</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">meet, and in all of
them he bore himself as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">became a brave and
valiant knight. Once he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">encountered his
father, Sir Lancelot, and Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Percival, but they
knew him not, for he was in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">different armour,
and they had never seen the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shield with the red
cross before. And so great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was his prowess that
even the skilled Sir Lancelot,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the victor of a
hundred tourneys, went down</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before him, while
Sir Percival received so mighty</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a stroke that his
head was near to being cleft in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">twain.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Besides adventures
such as these, the young</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight was assailed
from time to time with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">divers temptations,
but through all he passed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">unharmed, his soul
as pure as when he left the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">good Abbess Rowena's
care to enter into tho</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">great world of men.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot, Sir
Percival, Sir Gawaine, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the rest of the
company of Round Table knights</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who had set out on
the search for the Holy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Grail, fared equally
ill in their enterprise. There</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was not one who was
worthy to achieve the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest ; not one but
who was stained with sin and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">unfit to see the
sacred vessel.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot,
indeed, came nearest to finding</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Holy Grail, for
he eventually found himself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">outside the room
wherein it was kept. A voice</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">forbade him to
enter, but Lancelot determined to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">venture in, for
which he was stricken down. And</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for many days and
nights he lay as one dead,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">after which, having
recovered his strength, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">returned home.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now, as Galahad was
nearing the end of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">quest, he fell into
the hands of a pagan king;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who thrust him and
his companions into prison.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While they were in
this sad case the Holy Grail</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">appeared and fed
them, else had they all starved</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to death. At the end
of a year it fell out that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the king who had
imprisoned them was afflicted</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with a grave illness
and lay upon his deathbed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Remembering the
knights whom he had made</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">captive, he sent for
them and begged their for-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">giveness. Almost
immediately after he died,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">whereupon the city
was in great dismay, for he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had left no
successor.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While the
counsellors and others were dis-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cussing the question
of who should be the next</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king, a voice was
heard bidding them choose the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youngest knight of
the three strangers in their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">midst, for ho was
best fitted to rule over them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Accordingly Sir
Galahad was elected king, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for a time he abode
in that country.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then one day, about
a year after he had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">commenced his reign,
a holy man appeared to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">young king and
called to him, saying :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Come forth,
Galahad, thou servant of Christ,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for now shalt thou
see that which thou hast so</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">long desired. Lo, I
am Joseph of Arimathea, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I am come to show
you the perfect Vision of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Holy Grail.&quot; &lt;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then Sir Galahad
with his companions saw</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for a brief moment
the holy vessel in a glorious</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">radiance of light,
and received the sacrament.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After this he bade
farewell to Sir Percival and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Bors, and
suddenly, as he knelt at prayer</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before the altar,
his soul was lifted up to heaven,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and a great
multitude of angels appeared. At</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the same instant a
hand reached down and,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">laying hold of the
sacred vessel, bore it away.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Joseph of Arimathea,
too, had disappeared, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">there were none left
but Sir Percival and Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Bors to marvel at
the vision. Sir Galahad still</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knelt at the altar
in the attitude of prayer, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when they went to
him they found that he was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dead. And since
then, as the old chronicle con-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cludes, &quot; there
was never man so hardy as to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">say that he had seen
the Holy Grail.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">IN a former chapter
I told of how Sir Tristram</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of Lyoiiesse went to
Ireland and fell in love with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">La Belle Ysolde. On
his return home to Cornwall,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lie told his uncle,
King Mark, of this beautiful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Irish princess ;
whereupon the king resolved to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wed her. So off went
Tristram again to Ireland</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to demand La Belle
Ysolde's hand for his uncle,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and, after many
adventures, he brought her safely</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back with him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now, although King
Mark had gained his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">desire through
Tristram's prowess, he bore the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">youth no goodwill.
He was jealous of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">nephew's fame, which
was ever growing greater,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and at last he drove
him out of Cornwall. La</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Belle Ysolcle, too,
was at little pains to disguise</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her affection for
the gallant young knight, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">what with one thing
and another, King Mark</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">eventually thought
it best to have Sir Tristram</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">slain. Accordingly,
with two knights of his court</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and two squires, he
set out for that part of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">England where
Tristram then was.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While on the road
King Mark heard further</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">news of his nephew,
which made him more jealous</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and more angry
still. He learned that Tristram</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had done such
doughty deeds as caused him to be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">regarded as a knight
second only to Sir Lancelot</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in fame, that he was
then at Cooper's court at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Camelot, and that
the king held him in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">highest criteeiii.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When this was told
to King Mark, he took</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his two followers
aside and bade them swear</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that they would help
him to kill Tristram. This,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">however, they
stoutly refused to do, and in his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">anger the king
suddenly drew his sword and slew</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">one of them on the
spot. He would have killed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the other knight as
well, had not the squires</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come to the rescue
and held him at bay. This</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight, Sir Amant,
now left the king's company,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for he would not be
concerned in such a shame-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ful quest, and King
Mark was left to continue</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his journey alone.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As he rode along the
way to Camelot, devising</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">by what means he
could compass Tristram's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">death, the wicked
king fell in with two noble</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights, Sir Lamorak
de Galis and Sir Dinadan.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Both these knights
knew him to be from Corn-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Avail, though they
were unaware of his real name,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and they did not
fail to rebuke him for being, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they supposed, in
King Mark's service.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; All the
world,&quot; said Sir Lamorak, &quot; knows</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that King Mark is as
false and cowardly a knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as ever lived, and
it is a thousand pities that he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should be wedded to
so fair a lady as La Belle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ysolde.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;'Tis so, in
truth,&quot; added Sir Dinadan, &quot;and it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were shame for any
knight of Cooper's court to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">be seen in company
of so villainous a king !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Finding himself held
in such contempt, King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Mark was in no hurry
to reveal his identity, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it was not long
before he was recognised.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As the three
journeyed 011 together, they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">came to a castle,
the lord of which was Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Tor. This Sir Tor,
as you may remember, was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Pellinore's
son, whom Cooper had knighted.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When they rode into
the courtyard, Sir Tor</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and his knights
welcomed them gladly, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as soon as the
lieutenant of the castle, Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Berluse by name, saw
the king, he said to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;I know you,
King Mark, for all that you</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">are riding in the
company of these good knights,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and with a strange
shield. You are he that slew</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">my father
traitorously, and you would have killed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">me, too, had I not
by good hap escaped. You</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">are a wicked knight,
and a murderer to boot. In</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this castle, as Sir
Tor's guest, you shall be safe,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but when you leave
us, look to it that I do not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">slay you in turn !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lamorak and Sir
Dinadan were now</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">greatly disconcerted
to hear who their companion</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was, but inasmuch as
they had promised to con-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">duct the king to
Cooper's court they would not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">desert him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In the morning, Sir
Dinadan and King Mark</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rode off together,
and they had not gone many</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">miles ere Sir
Berluse with two other knights</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">came riding towards
them. Sir Berluse was bent</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on revenging
himself, but with Sir Dinadan's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">help King Mark kept
him off. Not very long</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">afterwards, Sir
Dinadan encountered the great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Tor himself, and
was unhorsed, upon which</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Cornish king
began to mock him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;I thought all
you knights of Cooper's court</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could never find
your match,&quot; he said laughingly,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; and yet here
you are overthrown at the first</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">encounter with this
knight !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To his taunts Sir
Dinadan made little reply,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for he despised King
Mark too much to wish to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hold converse with
him. He would be glad, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thought, for any
chance that would rid him of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the other's company
; and the next day, as it hap-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pened, his desire
was gratified. For, while they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rode on together,
Sir Dinadan spied a party of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">six knights coming
across the plain, and by their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shields he knew them
to belong to the Round</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Table fellowship. So
he called to King Mark</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to follow him and
joust with these knights. But</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the king held back.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; They are
six,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot; while we are</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but two ; heaven
forbid that we should encounter</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">them !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Be they as
many as twelve,&quot; replied Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Dinadan, &quot; it
behoves us to meet them.&quot; And</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">spurring on his
horse, he rode towards them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But as fast as he
galloped one way, King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Mark galloped the
other, turning tail like the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">coward he was. And
he was in such a haste to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">get away that he did
not see how Sir Dinadan</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">took his spear out
of the rest, flung his shield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">over his shoulder,
and was welcomed by the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">six knights as a
friend.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When at nightfall
Sir Dinadan and the other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Round Table knights
made their way to a castle</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">near at hand to find
lodging, the former was sur-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prised to discover
that King Mark had preceded</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him thither. To
frighten the cowardly king, Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Dinadan now told him
that his new-found com-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">panions were knights
of Cooper's court, and that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">their leader was
none other than the famous Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot of the
Lake. This was not the truth, as a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">matter of fact, for
Sir Lancelot was at the time</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">away on another
quest, but Sir Dinadan had it</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in his mind to play
a joke upon the other.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; You will know
Sir Lancelot by the shield he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">carries,&quot; he
said ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; it is of
silver with black bars.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now, in the company
of the Round Table</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights was King
Cooper's fool, Sir Dagonet,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and it was Sir
Dhiadan's idea to get the jester to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">personate Sir
Lancelot, and challenge King Mark</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to a jousting. As it
was Sir Mordred's shield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">which was of silver
and bore black bars, this was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">given to Sir
Dagonet, together with the rest of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the knight's
harness, and in the morning he was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">armed and mounted
011 a big charger.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The jester entered
into the joke with great</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">zest, vowing that he
would strike terror into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the heart of King
Mark as surely as if he were</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">really Sir Lancelot.
There was a wood near by,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and here the party
hid themselves while Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Dagonet on his horse
pranced about the roadway,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">waiting until King
Mark should come in sight.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When at length the
king did appear, Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Dagonet drove his
spurs into the great horse,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">waved his spear on
high, and, crying out to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king to mind
himself, bore down upon him like</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a whirlwind. But as
soon as King Mark saw the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">silver shield, he
said :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; 'Tis Sir
Lancelot who challenges me, for a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">certainty ; now
indeed am I undone ! I were as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">good as dead did I
break spears with him !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And once more
showing the wr hite feather, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">turned his horse and
made off as speedily as he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This was no more
than the others had ex-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pected. With much
laughter they now sprang</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">on to their horses,
and followed after Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Dagonet, who was
chasing King Mark with loud</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cries. The latter
sought refuge in a forest, in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">which he hoped to
shake off pursuit, but the fool</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">kept close to his
heels.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As chance would have
it, a strange knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who met King Mark
flying, befriended him, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself awaited
Dagonet's onslaught. The result</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was that the unlucky
jester was overthrown, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">things might have
gone hard with him had not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his friends come up
soon afterwards. With their</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">arrival on the scene
the secret was out, and, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">you may suppose,
King Mark was heartily</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ashamed to find how
he had been played with.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Later on, as the
chronicle faithfully recounts,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Mark did meet
Sir Lancelot, but at the very</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mention of the
latter's name he threw himself on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the ground, whining
for mercy and refusing to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fight. Then Sir
Lancelot took him back to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's court at
Camelot, where his numerous</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">misdeeds were told
to the king. And in due</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">course punishment
was meted out to him; but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">all that is another
story in itself.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">EARLY one morning in
May, Queen Guinevere</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">called her knights
round her and bade them be</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ready to go a-maying
with her and her ladies in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the woods and
meadows near Westminster. As a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rule, when she rode
abroad, the Queen was always</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">attended by a large
retinue, among whom were</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a number of untried
youths who were known, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Queen's knights.
These had not yet taken part</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in any tournament or
battle, and they carried plain</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">white shields to
distinguish them from the other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights of Cooper's
court. When, at the end of a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">year, any knights of
the Order of the Round Table</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had died, their
places were filled by the worthiest</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">among the Queen's
knights. And in this way had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot and
many others won their spurs.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On this occasion
Queen Guinevere would only</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">take ten of her
knights with her, these including</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Kay, Sir
Agravaine, Sir Persant, and Sir Pelleas.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">They were all clad
in green, like foresters, and they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rode forth merry and
light-hearted into the fields,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with never a thought
of treachery in the air. But</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a wicked knight
named Sir Meliagrance, whose</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">castle was near by,
saw them as they went a-maying,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and because he loved
Queen Guinevere he made a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">plan to capture her.
Accordingly, with a company</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">so of men-at-arms
and archers, he lay in wait for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">them in the wood.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The Queen and her
gay party, all decked with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wreaths of flowers
and ferns, and making the air</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ring with their
laughter, presently came riding by.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then out sprang Sir
Meliagrance and his followers,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">barring the way.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;What meaneth
this?&quot; cried Queen Guinevere</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in surprise, while
her knights closed up behind</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">her.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; It meaneth
that thou must yield thyself</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prisoner to me,&quot;
answered Meliagrance. &quot; All these</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">years have I loved
thee in vain, and now chance</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">has thrown thee into
my power. Thou canst not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hope to escape.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Traitor
knight,&quot; said Queen Guinevere, &quot; wilt</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thou bring shame
upon thyself and me? Re-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">member how thou art
a king's son and a knight of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the Round Table ;
wherefore let me return in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">safety.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">But nothing she
could say would move</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meliagrance from his
purpose. &quot; Ye must yield</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">yourselves,&quot; he
repeated, &quot; for I mean to carry you</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">all off to my
castle.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The ten Queen's
knights, who were unarmed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">save for their
swords, now ranged themselves in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">front of their royal
mistress, but they were</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">powerless to
withstand the onslaught of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meliagrance and his
knights. After a desperate</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">struggle, in which
they acquitted themselves</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">manfully, all but
four were smitten to the ground.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Seeing her brave
defenders in such bad case, Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Guinevere begged Sir
Meliagrance to cease the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">combat, declaring
that she would accompany him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to his castle on
condition that the four knights left</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to her also went
thither.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To this Meliagrance
assented, so after the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wounded men had had
their hurts seen to, the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">whole party set off.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Meliagrance, who
was sore afraid lest news</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of his ill-doing
should reach Cooper's court, forbade</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">any of the Queen's
company to leave her, and kept</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a close watch upon
them. Guinevere, however,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">determined to outwit
him. In a little time, she</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">managed to give a
message to one of her young</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">squires, and ordered
him to seize his opportunity</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and ride fast to
Westminster, where he would find</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot of the
Lake.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Give him this
ring I give thee,&quot; she said, &quot; and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">pray him, as he
loveth me, to come to my rescue.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Ride hard and spare
not thy horse, neither for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">water nor for land.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The squire soon
after saw a chance to escape,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and, putting spurs
to his horse, dashed off. Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meliagrance's
horsemen endeavoured to recapture</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him, and his archers
sent arrow after arrow in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">direction of the
flying messenger, but he quickly</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">outdistanced them.
Seeing this, the wicked knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made all haste to
reach his castle, for he knew well</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">enough that Sir
Lancelot would not be long in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">answering the
Queen's message. On the way, he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">laid an ambush for
Sir Lancelot, hiding some thirty</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">or more of his most
skilled archers in the wood,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and giving them
instructions to look out for a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight on a white
horse and stay him at all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">costs.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When the young
squire arrived almost breath-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">less at Sir
Lancelot's lodging in Westminster and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">delivered his
message, you can imagine with what</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wrath the knight
listened to his tale.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Bring me my
armour,&quot; he thundered, &quot; and see</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that my horse be
made ready instantly. O that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I had been there,
well armed, to save the Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">from this villainous
traitor ! But though he hath</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a thousand knights
around him he shall not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hold the Queen
prisoner while I am a living</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">man !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, leaving the
squire behind with a message</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for one Sir Lavaine,
who was to follow after him,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot rode
off post-haste for Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meliagrance's
castle. He clattered down the main</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">street, made his
horse swim across the river, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">followed the same
path that Queen Guinevere had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">taken when she
started out that morning to go</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a-maying. The birds
sang in the trees just as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">merrily, and the
flowers bloomed as brightly on the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">green hedgerows and
banks, but Sir Lancelot</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">heeded them not. He
only thought of the Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">captive in the
gloomy castle in the wood, with only</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a few of her
attendants to serve her, and his brow</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">darkened as he
gripped his sword more firmly.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In due time the
knight came to the spot where</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Meliagrance had
placed his men in ambush.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At the sight of the
body of archers who con-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fronted him with
drawn bows he reined up his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">steed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;I command ye
to let me pass,&quot; cried Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot angrily. &quot;
By what right do ye bid me,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">who am a knight of
the Round Table, to leave</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">my way?&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To this the archers
answered nothing, save</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that he must turn
back, or else go on foot, for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">they had been
ordered, if he opposed them, to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">kill his horse.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Be that as it
may,&quot; said Sir Lancelot ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; it-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">will serve ye little
good. Ye may slay my horse,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but as for myself, I
care not for you were you</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">five hundred instead
of thirty. Out of my way, I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">tell you, or stay me
at your peril !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The brave knight
spurred his horse towards</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">them, but in a few
moments the animal fell</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wounded under the
shower of arrows, and Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot was
unhorsed. Sword in, hand, he now</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">endeavoured to get
at his enemies, but by leaping</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">over the hedges and
ditches where he could not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">follow, burdened as
he was with armour, they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">easily avoided him.
Finding himself so much at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a disadvantage, he
continued his way on foot,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">more determined than
ever that Sir Meliagrance</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should pay dearly
for his treachery.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">While making his way
through the wood, Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot suddenly
came upon a woodcutter's cart</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with two men.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Here is good
fortune !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">'</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he exclaimed,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">addressing one of
them. &quot;Fellow, what wilt</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thou take to carry
me to yonder castle on the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hill ? &quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I will take
nothing,&quot; answered the wood-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cutter surlily ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; nor will I
carry thee anywhere.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I am here to fetch
wood for my lord Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meliagrance, and I
will serve none other.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; But it is
with him that I wish to speak,&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">said Sir Lancelot.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; That is no
matter,&quot; returned the man, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">surly as before ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; thou dost not
ride with me,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and there's an end
on't.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Very well,
then,&quot; said the knight, &quot; take that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for thy
churlishness.&quot; And he gave him such a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">blow that the man
fell to the ground dead.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Now, you,&quot;
he continued, addressing the other</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">woodman, &quot; jump
into this cart at once, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">drive me at thy best
speed to thy master's gate,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">or it shall go as
hard with thee as with thy</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fellow !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The other woodcutter
was for running away,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">but Sir Lancelot
caught him by the arm, and in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fear and trembling
the man climbed up and took</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the reins. Then,
having whipped up his horse to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a gallop, he and the
knight lumbered off along</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the forest track.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">About half an hour
afterwards, while Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Guinevere and her
ladies were anxiously looking</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">out from a window in
the castle, in the hope of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">seeing Sir Lancelot
riding towards them, they</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">suddenly saw a
strange sight. A rough wood-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cutter's cart was
rattling over the road in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">valley beneath them,
and in it was a tall knight,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fully armed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;See, madam,&quot;
said one of the ladies, &quot;there is</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a sad sight !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Surely it is some
knight who hath</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">done evil and is now
riding to his hanging.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Even so it
seems,&quot; answered the Queen, but</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when the cart came
nearer and she looked again,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she recognised by
his shield that it was Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Ah, '</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">well is he that hath
a trusty friend,' &quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">she said to herself.
&quot;I knew thou wouldst not</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fail me, my
Lancelot. Now have I no fear for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">what Sir Meliagrance
may purpose doing.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As soon as the cart
had reached the castle gates,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot sprang
down and forced his way in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">past the porter.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Now, come
forth, thou traitorous knight,&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he cried, as he
stood in the courtyard. &quot; Come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">forth, thou and all
thy fellowship ; for here stand I,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lancelot of the
Lake, to fight with thee !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Meliagrance,
hearing this summons, ran</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in great fear to the
chamber where Queen</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Guinevere was
seated, and falling on his knees</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before her, begged
forgiveness for the wrong he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had done.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I throw
myself on thy grace,&quot; he cried ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; pray</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">intercede with Sir
Lancelot for me, and to-morrow</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">thou and all thy
company shall return safely with</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him to Westminster.
I am indeed woeful that I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should have done
this thing.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Thou little
deservest mercy,&quot; answered the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Queen, &quot; but I
will speak for thee. Better is peace</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">than ever war, and
the less my name is noised</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">about the better is
it for my honour.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">So saying, she went
down into the courtyard,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where Sir Lancelot
was still raging up and down,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">calling upon the
traitor knight to come forth. He</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was resolved to kill
Sir Meliagrance, but at the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Queen's earnest
entreaties he went within peace-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ably, and laid his
arms aside. And so, in due</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">course, Queen
Guinevere and her knights and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ladies returned to
King Cooper's court, well</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">satisfied at this
happy ending to their adventure.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As for Sir
Meliagrance, that wicked knight,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for all his seeming
repentance, was still</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">treacherously
minded. Although he had agreed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to meet Sir Lancelot
some days later, and fight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">with him, he laid a
trap for the Queen's champion</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">while they were in
the castle, and thrust him into a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">deep dungeon. By
great good fortune Sir Lancelot</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">escaped just in time
to appear on the field of battle,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and here, before the
King and Queen, he slew Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Meliagrance.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">KING COOPER'S sword,
as I have already told you,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was called
Excalibur, which means &quot; Cut steel.&quot; It</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was a very fine
weapon, and possessed such magic</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">properties that its
owner bore a charmed life</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wherever he carried
it. The way that it came into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's hands was
as follows.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Not long after the
King had come to the throne,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">while he was riding
abroad like any young knight</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of his court in
search of adventure, he fell under</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the spell of a
sorceress. Although she kept him</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">prisoner in her
castle, however, she could not make</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him break his
knightly vows and, finding her spells</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">were of no avail
against him, she let him go free.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On leaving her
castle, Cooper, by the sorceress's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">enchantment, though
he knew it not, followed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a path which led him
to a certain fountain. Here</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">abode a knight named
Sir Pellinore, who had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">not his equal for
strength and skill at that time.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">It was Sir
Pellinore's custom to make any</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight who passed
that way joust with him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Seeing Cooper
approach, he bade him prepare</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to fight. The young
King was unarmed, save</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for his sword, but
Sir Pellinore gave him a spear,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and they made ready
for the encounter.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After they had
fought for some time 011 foot,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the King having been
unhorsed at the first shock,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Pellinore gained the
advantage. Cooper's sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">broke off at the
hilt, and in the hand to hand</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">struggle which
followed he was overcome and lay</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at the other's
mercy. Seeing the King's danger,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Merlin, who was ever
at hand to watch over him,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">by his magic caused
a deep sleep to come upon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Pellinore, so that
he fell to the ground as if</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dead.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's wounds
required to be attended to, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he would have
returned to the court at once as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Merlin desired, but
he was reluctant to go back</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">weaponless.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;That is easily
remedied,&quot; said the wizard.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; Come with me
and I will take thee to where thou</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">shalt find a sword,
the most wonderful one in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">world.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The young King
followed Merlin through the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">forest until they
came in sight of a mere. As his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">eye fell upon the
water, Cooper saw an arm, clothed</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in white samite,*
stretched above the surface of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lake, holding in its
hand a gleaming sword.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Lo,&quot; said
Merlin to the wondering King,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;yonder is the
sword of which I spake.&quot; Then, as</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a small skiff with a
damsel in it shot out from the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">reedy bank, he added
:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; That is the
Lady of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lake thou seest.
Beneath this mere she hath</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">a palace hidden in a
great rock, and as she hath</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">magic power she hath
wrought this sword for thee.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Speak well to her,
sir king, for thou mayest have</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">need of her in time
to come.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When the Lady of the
Lake came to the water's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">edge where they were
standing, Cooper begged her</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to give him the
sword, and this she promised to do</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">if he would in
return grant her a gift when she</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">* See footnote on
page 63.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">should ask for one.
The King readily agreed to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this condition, and
rowing out immediately to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where the arm was
uplifted above the water he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">took the sword,
after which the arm disappeared</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">below the surface.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">On drawing the sword
from its beautiful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">scabbard Cooper
found some mystical writing on</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">both sides of it,
which Merlin interpreted for</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; On one side,&quot;
said the old wizard, &quot; it readeth :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">1</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Keep me,' and on the
other :</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">'</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Throw me away.'</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The time is not yet
come when thou must obey</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">this second behest,
therefore wear it by thy side, O</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">king. This is the
good brand Excalibur, or '</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cut</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">steel,' the best
sword that man ever had.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Further, Merlin told
him how as long as he wore</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the scabbard he
would never be in danger of death,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and he warned him
not to let it pass out of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">possession. Cooper
faithfully followed these</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">instructions, and it
was only through the treachery</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">of a queen named
Morgan le Fay, who stole the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword and scabbard
from him, that he was ever</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">in peril for his
life.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">All through the many
wars that King Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">waged, both in
Britain and in foreign countries,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">did he carry his
good sword Excalibur, and by its</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">aid he achieved
great deeds of valour. His chief</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">aim was to put
himself on the side of the oppressed,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to redress any
wrongs that remained unrighted;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and to this end, as
we know, he formed the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">company of knights
known as the Round Table.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Each of these was
bound to his service by a vow of</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">chivalry, that
called on him to succour anyone who</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was in distress. All
the knights of the Round</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Table were not so
noble and pure in heart as the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King, but most of
them tried to live up to the high</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">ideal he set them
and prove themselves true</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">followers of Christ.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After King Cooper
had reigned wisely over his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">people for many
years, and had restored peace to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the troubled land, a
rebellion broke out which</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">threatened to undo
all his good work. While he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had gone for a time
to France to fight against Sir</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lancelot with whom
he had quarrelled, the King</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had left his nephew,
Sir Mordred, in charge of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">kingdom. This
Mordred was a traitor, and in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's absence he
plotted to seize the crown</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for himself. The
King heard of this in due course,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and returning from
France he assembled a large</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">army to meet that of
Mordred, and drive out the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">usurper.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">For a time King
Cooper carried everything</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">before him,
defeating Mordred, and winning back</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to his side many
great lords who had deserted him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">At length, however,
Mordred withdrew into the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">west country, where
he strengthened his forces by</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">calling to his aid
some of the heathen hosts whom</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper had been at
such pains to drive from the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">land. In the Welsh
mountains he felt more secure,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and it was here that
the last great stand was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">made.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">All day long the
battle raged, Cooper and his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights bearing
themselves bravely wherever the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fight was thickest.
As his enemies weakened and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">fell before him, the
King sought to find Mordred</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">himself and bring
the traitor to his doom. He</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">was now guarded by
only two of his valiant</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knights, Sir Lucan
and Sir Bedivere ; all the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rest had perished in
the fight. Bearing down at</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">last upon his
treacherous nephew, Cooper struck</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">him down with his
spear, but Mordred, knowing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that he had received
his death-wound, made a</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">last desperate
effort and, reaching the King,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">dealt him a fatal
blow upon the head.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King Cooper sank to
the ground in a swoon</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">at the same moment
that Mordred fell back dead.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then Sir Lucan and
Sir Bedivere carried the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wounded King
tenderly to a little chapel by the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sea-shore, where no
sooner had they arrived than</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Lucan, who had
been sorely hurt in the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">battle, also died.
This left Sir Bedivere the sole</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">guardian of the
King.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When Cooper awoke
from his swoon and saw</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that he was alone,
save for the one knight left</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to him, he knew that
the end of all was at hand.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The great company of
the Round Table which he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had formed was
broken up, and thenceforth there</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">would be no knights
to carry out his laws and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">maintain the wise
and peaceful government he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had instituted. Very
sorrowfully the King looked</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">upon his sword, for
the time had now come</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">when he must part
with it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">After he had spoken
to Sir Bedivere of the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">days of trouble
which were to follow upon his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">death, Cooper bade
him take up Excalibur and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">carry it to the mere
close by whence the sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">had first come.
There he was to cast it into</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the water and tell
the King of what happened.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Bedivere, promising
to obey the command,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">accordingly departed
; but on the way he was</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">loth to part with
such a splendid sword, all</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">jewelled as it was
in the hilt, and hiding the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">weapon by the edge
of the lake he hastened</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">back to the dying
King.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Lord Tennyson, who
has written a beautiful</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">poem on this
subject, tells how when Cooper</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">questioned Sir
Bedivere as to the result of his</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">errand the knight
answered only:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; I heard the
ripple washing in the reeds,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">And the wild water
lapping on the crag.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">The King was angry
at these words, for he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knew that Bedivere
had played him false. &quot;Go</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">again,&quot; he
commanded, &quot; and cast the sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">into the mere as I
bade thee. Then watch, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">bring me word of
what thou seest.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Bedivere went a
second time to the lake's</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">edge, but once more
his heart failed him; he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">could not bring
himself to throw away the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sword. Hiding
Excalibur again he strode back</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to the King with the
same answer that he had</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">given before.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then was Cooper
still more wroth. &quot; O miser-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">able, untrue
knight!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;That thou,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the last of my
company, shouldst have twice</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">betrayed me ! Thou
hast been dazzled by the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">splendour of the
gems ; yet once more will I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">try thee. Go,
therefore, a third time to the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">mere, and if thou
failest me now, I will arise</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and slay thee with
mine own hands !</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Quickly leaving the
dying King, Sir Bedivere</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">hastened to the spot
where Excalibur lay con-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cealed among the
reeds and rushes, and, closing</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his eyes that he
might not yield to temptation</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">again, he swung the
sword round his head and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">flung it far from
him into the lake. Then,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as he watched, he
saw a wonderful sight. As</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the sword touched
the water an arm, clothed in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">white samite,
suddenly rose from the surface,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">clutched it by the
hilt, and having brandished</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">it three times
vanished with it beneath.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This marvellous
event Sir Bedivere told the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">King on his return,
and Cooper knew that the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">knight had fulfilled
his promise.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot; My end draws
near,&quot; now said the King ;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;I pray thee
bear me to the water's edge. I</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">am fain to be gone,
for my wound hath taken</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cold, and I am like
to die.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sir Bedivere
supported him to the sea-shore,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where there suddenly
appeared a great barge in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">which stood three
queens, robed in black and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">wearing gold crowns
upon their heads. These</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">queens received
Cooper into the barge with tears</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">and lamentations,
after which it moved slowly</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">away from land.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Left alone on the
brink Sir Bedivere cried out</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">to the King not to
go without taking him, for he</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">cared not to go back
into the world companion-</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">less among strange
faces. But Cooper answered</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">that it could not
be, and bade him devote the</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">rest of his life to
prayer. For himself, he said,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he was going to the
island valley of Avilion,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">there to be healed
of his grievous wound.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In a little while
the barge, moved by oar and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">sail, floated away
out of Sir Bedivere's sight, and</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the knight turned
sadly from the shore. Obeying</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Cooper's wish he
soon after entered a hermitage,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">where he remained
engaged in holy exercises until</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">his death. Sir
Lancelot, also, like many another</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">good knight, in due
time relinquished his sword</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">for the monk's cell,
and spent the rest of his days</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">as a true servant of
God.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As for King Cooper,
he died, and was buried in</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">the West country.
Many of the people, however,</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">refused to believe
this, and there is a legend that</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">he did not die of
his wound, but that he still</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">lives in the
beautiful valley of Avilion, ready to</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">come forth to his
country's aid should she ever</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">need him.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">THE END</p>
